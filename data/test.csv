"deal to ban 'homophobic' reggae  the reggae industry is to refuse to release or stage concerts featuring homophobic songs under a global deal struck with gay rights groups.  a damaging campaign against stars such as beenie man and sizzla has been waged over lyrics that allegedly call for gay people to be killed or assaulted. the campaign, which led to gigs being scrapped and a uk police investigation, will now be dropped under the truce. brett lock of gay group outrage! said they were ""wiping the slate clean"". the protests had been led by the stop murder music coalition, an umbrella group including outrage!, the black gay men's advisory group and jamaican movement j-flag.  that coalition has reached a verbal agreement with major dancehall reggae record labels and concert promoters covering eight of the scene's biggest stars. but the artists themselves were not involved in the negotiations and have not directly signed up. instead, the record companies have pledged not to release or re-release any offensive songs - many of which date back a number of years. and it is believed promoters will make stars agree not to perform such tunes on stage. ""the reggae industry will work with the artists while still maintaining their freedom of speech and artistic freedom,"" according to media and pr strategist glen yearwood, who is representing the reggae industry.  the industry would halt any attempt by an artist to perform or release a song inciting violence against any group or gender, he said. ""we'll advise them this is not the way forward in a civilised society."" the stop murder music campaign saw protesters picket gigs, resulted in sizzla's uk tour being cancelled in november, forced mobo award organisers to drop artists from nominations and saw beenie man dropped from an mtv show in august. police have also been investigating whether lyrics incite the assault and murder of gay people. the campaign was a blow to the reggae industry, mr yearwood admitted. ""if you can't have major stars touring, then you don't sell many albums,"" he said.  but the artists - beenie man, sizzla, elephant man, buju banton, bounty killer, tok, capleton and vybz kartel - will not have to apologise for past songs or comments. outrage!'s mr lock said: ""the main players in the dancehall reggae industry will attempt to regulate the industry themselves to ensure that there aren't any violently homophobic or gay-bashing lyrics in the future. ""as a gesture of good faith, the stop murder music coalition has agreed to suspend our aggressive campaigning against murder music. ""so we shall not be picketing concerts or calling for prosecutions to give the industry the space to regulate and reform itself."" record companies vp and greensleeves, distributor jet star and concert promoters including jammins and apollo entertainment are all on board.","the industry would halt any attempt by an artist to perform or release a song inciting violence against any group or gender, he said.the reggae industry is to refuse to release or stage concerts featuring homophobic songs under a global deal struck with gay rights groups.'s mr lock said: ""the main players in the dancehall reggae industry will attempt to regulate the industry themselves to ensure that there aren't any violently homophobic or gay-bashing lyrics in the future.the protests had been led by the stop murder music coalition, an umbrella group including outrage!, the black gay men's advisory group and jamaican movement j-flag.a damaging campaign against stars such as beenie man and sizzla has been waged over lyrics that allegedly call for gay people to be killed or assaulted.brett lock of gay group outrage!the campaign was a blow to the reggae industry, mr yearwood admitted.""the reggae industry will work with the artists while still maintaining their freedom of speech and artistic freedom,"" according to media and pr strategist glen yearwood, who is representing the reggae industry.the stop murder music campaign saw protesters picket gigs, resulted in sizzla's uk tour being cancelled in november, forced mobo award organisers to drop artists from nominations and saw beenie man dropped from an mtv show in august.that coalition has reached a verbal agreement with major dancehall reggae record labels and concert promoters covering eight of the scene's biggest stars."

"sculthorpe wants lions captaincy  paul sculthorpe has admitted he would love to succeed andy farrell as great britain skipper if the wigan star does switch codes to rugby union.  sculthorpe was vice-captain in the tri-nations, and took the st helens captaincy from chris joynt last year.

""financially it could set him up for life. if he fancies a new challenge, then who could fault him?"" sculthorpe also called on the rugby league authorities to have a serious look at the number of games the top players are being asked to play. sean long, sculthorpe's saints and lions team-mate, has expressed doubts about his international future ""i think sean's situation is to do with the sheer number of games we're playing,"" he said.

"us woman sues over ink cartridges  a us woman is suing hewlett packard (hp), saying its printer ink cartridges are secretly programmed to expire on a certain date.  the unnamed woman from georgia says that a chip inside the cartridge tells the printer that it needs re-filling even when it does not. the lawsuit seeks to represent anyone in the us who has purchased an hp inkjet printer since february 2001. hp, the world's biggest printer firm, declined to comment on the lawsuit. hp ink cartridges use a chip technology to sense when they are low on ink and advise the user to make a change.  but the suit claims the chips also shut down the cartridges at a predetermined date regardless of whether they are empty. ""the smart chip is dually engineered to prematurely register ink depletion and to render a cartridge unusable through the use of a built-in expiration date that is not revealed to the consumer,"" the suit said. the lawsuit is asking for restitution, damages and other compensation. the cost of printer cartridges has been a contentious issue in europe for the last 18 months. the price of inkjet printers has come down to as little as £34 but it could cost up to £1,700 in running costs over an 18-month period due to cartridge, a study by computeractive magazine revealed last year. the inkjet printer market has been the subject of an investigation by the uk's office of fair trading (oft), which concluded in a 2002 report that retailers and manufacturers needed to make pricing more transparent for consumers.","a us woman is suing hewlett packard (hp), saying its printer ink cartridges are secretly programmed to expire on a certain date.the cost of printer cartridges has been a contentious issue in europe for the last 18 months.the lawsuit seeks to represent anyone in the us who has purchased an hp inkjet printer since february 2001.the price of inkjet printers has come down to as little as £34 but it could cost up to £1,700 in running costs over an 18-month period due to cartridge, a study by computeractive magazine revealed last year.hp ink cartridges use a chip technology to sense when they are low on ink and advise the user to make a change."

"sir paul rocks super bowl crowds  sir paul mccartney wowed fans with a live mini-concert at american football's super bowl - and avoided any janet jackson-style controversies.  the 62-year-old sang hey jude and other beatles songs in a 12-minute set at half-time during the game in florida. last year, jackson exposed a breast during a dance routine, causing outrage among millions of tv viewers and landing the cbs tv network a fine. sir paul, however, did nothing more racy than remove his jacket as he sang. organisers were widely considered to be playing it safe this year by booking 62-year-old sir paul for his second super bowl show.  three years ago, he was invited to perform at the first super bowl after the september 11 attacks and performed his specially-written song freedom. this time, he started off the show, at the alltel stadium in jacksonville, florida, with the beatles numbers drive my car and get back. he then performed a mellow version of live and let die, the james bond theme he recorded with the band wings. finally, he closed the show with a rousing version of hey jude. the former beatle resisted any temptation to refer to janet jackson's headline-grabbing performance last year, instead keeping banter between songs to a minimum in order to squeeze as much music as he could into his slot. the singer removed his black jacket halfway through the show - but any fans hoping for a second ""nipple-gate"" were to be disappointed as he kept his red sweatshirt on underneath.  earlier, the black eyed peas and alicia keys had provided the night's other high-profile entertainment by performing in a pre-game show. black eyed peas singer fergie was dressed in a tight orange top and purple hotpants, but nothing in her performance was likely to upset tv watchdogs. after the controversy last year - which saw cbs fined a record $550,000 (£292,000) by federal regulators - super bowl organisers had turned to producer don mischer to oversee this year's half-time show. his previous production credits included olympic opening and closing ceremonies. the super bowl is watched by an audience of 144.4 million in the us, with many of the people watching are said to tune in specifically to see the entertainment put on around the event. michael jackson, aerosmith, diana ross, gloria estefan and phil collins are among the stars who have previously graced the super bowl stage.","organisers were widely considered to be playing it safe this year by booking 62-year-old sir paul for his second super bowl show.after the controversy last year - which saw cbs fined a record $550,000 (£292,000) by federal regulators - super bowl organisers had turned to producer don mischer to oversee this year's half-time show.three years ago, he was invited to perform at the first super bowl after the september 11 attacks and performed his specially-written song freedom.sir paul mccartney wowed fans with a live mini-concert at american football's super bowl - and avoided any janet jackson-style controversies.finally, he closed the show with a rousing version of hey jude.the 62-year-old sang hey jude and other beatles songs in a 12-minute set at half-time during the game in florida.the singer removed his black jacket halfway through the show - but any fans hoping for a second ""nipple-gate"" were to be disappointed as he kept his red sweatshirt on underneath."
"indonesia 'declines debt freeze'  indonesia no longer needs the debt freeze offered by the paris club group of creditors, economics minister aburizal bakrie has reportedly said.  indonesia, which originally accepted the debt moratorium offer, owes the paris club about $48bn (£25.5bn). mr bakrie told the bisnis indonesia newspaper that a $1.7bn donors' aid package meant that the debt moratorium was unnecessary. this aid comes on top of a previously-pledged $3.4bn package. most of this 'normal aid' would be used to finance the country's budget deficit. the indonesian economics minister explained that the money - $1.2bn in grants and $500m in soft loans - was for the rebuilding of aceh province, which was badly hit by the tsunami of 26 december. nevertheless, one of mr bakrie's deputies, mahendra siregar, told afp news agency that indonesia was still considering the offer by the paris club of rich creditor nations to temporarily suspend its debt payments. ""what is true is that we are still discussing... the paris club decision to find out more details such as how much of our debt will be subject to a moratorium. that's how far we are at this stage,"" said mr siregar.  the 19 member countries of the paris club are owed about $5bn this year in debt repayments by nations affected by the indian ocean tsunami. indonesia, sri lanka and the seychelles accepted the paris club offer, which was criticised by some aid groups as being too little. thailand and india have however declined the offer, with thailand prefering to keep up with its payments while india said it would prefer to rely on its own resources rather than on international aid. putting off payments may lower a country's rating among financial organisations, making it more expensive and more difficult for them to borrow money in the future, analysts said. separately, the indonesian government has said it will announce monthly how much it has received in foreign donations and how it has spent the money. welfare minister alwi shihab told ap news agency that this announcement should allay suspicion of official corruption in relief operations.","indonesia, which originally accepted the debt moratorium offer, owes the paris club about $48bn (£25.5bn).mr bakrie told the bisnis indonesia newspaper that a $1.7bn donors' aid package meant that the debt moratorium was unnecessary.indonesia no longer needs the debt freeze offered by the paris club group of creditors, economics minister aburizal bakrie has reportedly said.nevertheless, one of mr bakrie's deputies, mahendra siregar, told afp news agency that indonesia was still considering the offer by the paris club of rich creditor nations to temporarily suspend its debt payments.indonesia, sri lanka and the seychelles accepted the paris club offer, which was criticised by some aid groups as being too little.the 19 member countries of the paris club are owed about $5bn this year in debt repayments by nations affected by the indian ocean tsunami."
"downloads enter us singles chart  digital music downloads are being included in the main us singles chart for the first time.  billboard's hot 100 chart now incorporates data from sales of music downloads, previously only assigned to a separate download chart. green day's boulevard of broken dreams is currently number two in billboard's pop chart, and tops its digital chart. download sales are due to be incorporated into the uk singles chart later this year.  digital sales in the us are already used to compile billboard's hot digital sales chart. they will now be tallied with sales of physical singles and airplay information to make up its new hot 100 chart. its second new chart - the pop 100 - also combines airplay, digital and physical sales but confines its airplay information to us radio stations which play chart music. in addition to green day, other artists in the current us digital sales top 10 include kelly clarkson, the game and the killers.  sales of legally downloaded songs shot up more than tenfold in 2004, with 200 million track purchased online in the us and europe in 12 months, the international federation of the phonographic industry (ifpi) reported last month. in the uk sales of song downloads overtook those for physical singles for the first time at the end of last year. the last week of december 2004 saw download sales of 312,000 compared with 282,000 physical singles, according to the british phonographic industry. the uk's first official music download chart was launched last september, compiling the most popular tracks downloaded from legal uk sites - including itunes, od2, mycokemusic.com and napster. westlife's flying without wings - a 1999 track reissued for the occasion - was the first number one of the uk download chart.  a spokesman for the british phonographic industry (bpi) said the first combined uk download and sales chart was due to be compiled ""within the first half of this year"". ""work is going on across the music business right now to make sure the new chart works to plan,"" he said. the bpi spokesman described the uk music download chart, compiled by the official charts company, as having been ""a great success"" since its launch.

"tough rules for ringtone sellers  firms that flout rules on how ringtones and other mobile extras are sold could be cut off from all uk phone networks.  the rules allow offenders to be cut off if they do not let consumers know exactly what they get for their money and how to turn off the services. the first month under the new rules has seen at least ten firms suspended while they clean up the way they work. the rules have been brought in to ensure that the problems plaguing net users do not spread to mobile phones.  in the last couple of years ringtones, wallpapers, screensavers and lots of other extras for phones have become hugely popular. but fierce competition is making it difficult for firms to get their wares in front of consumers, said jeremy flynn, head of third party services at vodafone.  ""if you are not on the operator's portal you are going to have quite heavy marketing costs because it's a problem of how people discover your services,"" he said. to combat this many ringtone and other mobile content sellers started using a new tactic to squeeze more cash out of customers. this tactic involved signing people up for a subscription to give them, for instance, several ringtones per week or month instead of the single track they thought they were getting. mr flynn said that the move to using subscriptions happened over the space of a few weeks at the end of 2004. websites such as grumbletext.co.uk started getting reports from customers who were racking up large bills for phone content they did not know they had signed up for. ""what made us uncomfortable was that these services were not being marketed transparently,"" said mr flynn. ""people did not know they were being offered a subscription service."" ""we saw potential for substantial consumer harm here,"" he added.  the swift adoption of subscription services led to the creation of a new code of conduct for firms that want to sell content for mobile phones. the drafting of the new rules was led by the mobile entertainment forum and the uk's phone firms. ""everyone is required to conform to this code of conduct,"" said andrew bud, regulatory head of the mef and executive chairman of messaging firm mblox.  ""it's all about transparency,"" he said. ""consumers have to be told what they have got themselves into and how to get out of it."" ""the consumer has a right to be protected,"" he said. christian harris, partnership manager of mobile content firm zed, said the new system was essential if consumers were to trust companies that sell ringtones and other downloads. ""the groundrules must be applied across the whole industry and if that's done effectively we will see the cowboys driven out,"" he said. the new rules came in to force on 15 january and the first month under the new regime has seen many firms cautioned for not honouring them. some have been told to revamp websites so customers know what they get for their money and what they are signing up for, said mr flynn. also, said mr flynn, vodafone has briefly cut off between eight and ten content sellers flouting the rules. ""we have quite draconian contracts with firms,"" he said. ""we do not have to say why. we can just cut them off."" under the rules consumers must be able to switch off the services by using a universal ""stop"" command sent via text message. he said the system had been designed to limit how much a consumer will pay if they inadvertently signed up for a service. ""the mobile is so personal that people really resent the abuse of what is effectively part of their personality,"" said mr flynn.","christian harris, partnership manager of mobile content firm zed, said the new system was essential if consumers were to trust companies that sell ringtones and other downloads.some have been told to revamp websites so customers know what they get for their money and what they are signing up for, said mr flynn.also, said mr flynn, vodafone has briefly cut off between eight and ten content sellers flouting the rules.""the consumer has a right to be protected,"" he said.""the mobile is so personal that people really resent the abuse of what is effectively part of their personality,"" said mr flynn.""what made us uncomfortable was that these services were not being marketed transparently,"" said mr flynn.""it's all about transparency,"" he said.mr flynn said that the move to using subscriptions happened over the space of a few weeks at the end of 2004.but fierce competition is making it difficult for firms to get their wares in front of consumers, said jeremy flynn, head of third party services at vodafone.he said the system had been designed to limit how much a consumer will pay if they inadvertently signed up for a service.the swift adoption of subscription services led to the creation of a new code of conduct for firms that want to sell content for mobile phones.firms that flout rules on how ringtones and other mobile extras are sold could be cut off from all uk phone networks.the rules allow offenders to be cut off if they do not let consumers know exactly what they get for their money and how to turn off the services."
"telewest to challenge sky plus  cable firm telewest is to offer a personal video recorder (pvr) in a set -top box to challenge sky plus.  sky plus is the market leader in the field of digital video recorders in the uk, with 474,000 subscribers. pvrs record tv programmes to a hard drive, letting viewers pause, and rewind live television and effectively ""time shift"" the viewing experience. a number of pvrs incorporating freeview digital terrestrial tv are also on the market but their success is limited. telewest's pvr will offer a 160gb hard drive, which has storage for up to 80 hours of programmes. the box has three tuners, which means viewers can record two channels simultaneously while watching a third channel.  sky plus boxes come in two versions - a 20gb version for £99 and a 160gb version for £399. sky also charges a £10 subscription fee to the service, unless viewers have a subscription to one of its premium packages. telewest has yet to reveal pricing for the new box or if it will be charging a subscription fee for the service.  eric tveter, president and chief operating officer at telewest broadband, said: ""we will make our pvr set-top box available later this year, putting a stop to missed soaps, interrupted films and arguments over which programmes to record."" pvrs and recordable dvd players are set to replace video recorders as the standard method of recording and saving favourite tv programmes. last year, high street retailer dixons said it was going to stop selling vhs machines in favour of pvrs and recordable dvd machines. sky has said it aims to have 25% of its subscribers using sky plus by 2010 - it is predicting 10 million total subscribers by that date. it currently has 7.4 million subscribers, while telewest provides digital cable to 1.7 million customers.","cable firm telewest is to offer a personal video recorder (pvr) in a set -top box to challenge sky plus.sky plus is the market leader in the field of digital video recorders in the uk, with 474,000 subscribers.sky has said it aims to have 25% of its subscribers using sky plus by 2010 - it is predicting 10 million total subscribers by that date.telewest has yet to reveal pricing for the new box or if it will be charging a subscription fee for the service.it currently has 7.4 million subscribers, while telewest provides digital cable to 1.7 million customers.telewest's pvr will offer a 160gb hard drive, which has storage for up to 80 hours of programmes."
"wales silent on grand slam talk  rhys williams says wales are still not thinking of winning the grand slam despite a third six nations win.  ""that's the last thing on our minds at the moment,"" said williams, a second- half replacement in saturday's 24-18 win over france in paris. ""we all realise how difficult a task it is to go up to scotland and beat them. ""we've come unstuck there a couple of times recently so our focus is on that game and we'll worry about ireland hopefully after we've beaten scotland."" with captain gareth thomas ruled out of the rest of the campaign with a broken thumb, williams is vying for his first start in the championship so far.  kevin morgan is probably favourite to replace thomas at full-back, leaving williams and hal luscombe to battle for the right wing berth. a hamstring injury denied luscombe the opportunity to make a third successive start, but the dragons winger is expected to be fit for the trip to murrayfield on 13 march. hooker robin mcbryde is doubtful after picking up a knee injury in paris, but centre sonny parker and flanker colin charvis are set to recover from injury to be in contention for selection. said wales assistant coach scott johnson: ""they've worked through the weekend and the reports are a bit more positive.

"big war games battle it out  the arrival of new titles in the popular medal of honor and call of duty franchises leaves fans of wartime battle titles spoilt for choice.  the acclaimed pc title call of duty has been updated for console formats, building on many of the original's elements. for its part, the long-running medal of honor series has added pacific assault to its pc catalogue, adapting the console game rising sun. call of duty: finest hour casts you as a succession of allied soldiers fighting on world war 2 battlefronts including russia and north africa. it is a traditional first-person-viewed game that lets you control just one character, in the midst of a unit where cohorts constantly bark orders at you. on a near-identical note, medal of honor: pacific assault does all it can to make you feel part of a tight-knit team and plum in the middle of all-out action. its arenas are the war's pacific battles, including guadalcanal and pearl harbour. you play one character throughout, a raw and rather talkative us soldier.  both games rely on a carefully stage-managed structure that keeps things ticking along. when this works, it is a brilliant device to make you feel part of a story. when it does not, it is tedious.  a winning moment is an early scene in pacific assault, where you come under attack at the famous us base in hawaii. you are first ushered into a gunboat attacking the incoming waves of japanese planes, then made to descend into a sinking battleship to rescue crewman, before seizing the anti-aircraft guns. it is one of the finest set-pieces ever seen in a video game. this notion of shuffling the player along a studiously pre-determined path, forcibly witnessing a series of pre-set moments of action, is a perilous business which can make the whole affair feel stilted rather than organic. the genius of something like half life 2 is that it skilfully disguises its linear plotting by various means of misdirection. this pair of games do not really accomplish that, being more concerned with imparting a full-on atmospheric experience.  call of duty comes with a suitably bombastic score and overblown presentation. finest hour has a similar determination, framing everything in moody wartime music, archive footage and lots of reflective voice-overs.  letting you play a number of different roles is an interesting ploy that adds new dimensions to the call of duty endeavour, even if it sacrifices the narrative flow somewhat. the game's drawback could be said to be its format; tastes differ, but these wartime shooters often do seem to work better on pc. the mouse control is a big reason why, along with the sharper graphics a top-end computer can muster and the apparent notion that pc games are allowed to get away with a bit more subtlety. call of duty on pc was more detailed, plot-wise and graphically, and this new adaptation feels a little rough and ready. targeting with the ps2 controller proved tricky, not helped by unconvincing collision-detection. you can shoot an enemy repeatedly with zero question as to your aim, yet the bullets will just refuse to hit him. checkpoints are so few and far between that when you get shot, which happens regularly, you are set harshly far back, and will find yourself covering vast tracts of scorched earth again and again. the game wants to be a challenge, and is, and many players will like it for that. it is as dynamic a battlefield simulator as you will experience and even if it is not as refined as its pc parent, the sense of being part of the action is thoroughly impressive.  both of these games feature military colleagues who are disturbingly bad shots and prone to odd behaviour. and in pacific assault in particular, their commands and comments are irritatingly meaningless.  but the teamwork element in titles like this is superficial, designed to add atmosphere and camaraderie rather than affect the gameplay mechanics at all. of the two games, pacific assault gets more things right, including little points like auto-saving intelligently and having tidier presentation. it engages you very well and also looks wonderful, making the most of the lush tropical settings that are reminiscent of the glorious far cry, although we had to ramp up the settings on a high-spec machine to get the most out of them. finest hour is by no means bad, and it is only because the pc original was so dazzling that this version sometimes feels underwhelming. those looking for a wartime game with plenty of atmosphere and a hearty abundance of enemies to shoot will be contented. but they will also have a niggling puzzlement as to why it does not break a little more ground rather then just being competent.","for its part, the long-running medal of honor series has added pacific assault to its pc catalogue, adapting the console game rising sun.on a near-identical note, medal of honor: pacific assault does all it can to make you feel part of a tight-knit team and plum in the middle of all-out action.call of duty on pc was more detailed, plot-wise and graphically, and this new adaptation feels a little rough and ready.of the two games, pacific assault gets more things right, including little points like auto-saving intelligently and having tidier presentation.the acclaimed pc title call of duty has been updated for console formats, building on many of the original's elements.the game wants to be a challenge, and is, and many players will like it for that.those looking for a wartime game with plenty of atmosphere and a hearty abundance of enemies to shoot will be contented.it is one of the finest set-pieces ever seen in a video game.finest hour is by no means bad, and it is only because the pc original was so dazzling that this version sometimes feels underwhelming.the mouse control is a big reason why, along with the sharper graphics a top-end computer can muster and the apparent notion that pc games are allowed to get away with a bit more subtlety.the arrival of new titles in the popular medal of honor and call of duty franchises leaves fans of wartime battle titles spoilt for choice.call of duty: finest hour casts you as a succession of allied soldiers fighting on world war 2 battlefronts including russia and north africa.it is a traditional first-person-viewed game that lets you control just one character, in the midst of a unit where cohorts constantly bark orders at you.both games rely on a carefully stage-managed structure that keeps things ticking along.this notion of shuffling the player along a studiously pre-determined path, forcibly witnessing a series of pre-set moments of action, is a perilous business which can make the whole affair feel stilted rather than organic."

"iran jails blogger for 14 years  an iranian weblogger has been jailed for 14 years on charges of spying and aiding foreign counter-revolutionaries.  arash sigarchi was arrested last month after using his blog to criticise the arrest of other online journalists. mr sigarchi, who also edits a newspaper in northern iran, was sentenced by a revolutionary court in the gilan area. his sentence, criticised by human rights watchdog reporters without borders, comes a day after an online ""day of action"" to secure his release. iranian authorities have recently clamped down on the growing popularity of weblogs, restricting access to major blogging sites from within iran. a second iranian blogger, motjaba saminejad, who also used his website to report on bloggers' arrests, is still being held.  a spokesman for reporters without borders, which tracks press freedom across the globe, described mr sigarchi's sentence as ""harsh"" and called on iranian president mohammed khatami to work to secure his immediate release. ""the authorities are trying to make an example of him,"" the organisation said in a statement.  ""by handing down this harsh sentence against a weblogger, their aim is to dissuade journalists and internet-users from expressing themselves online or contacting foreign media."" in the days before his arrest mr sigarchi gave interviews to the bbc persian service and the us-funded radio farda. iranian authorities have arrested about 20 online journalists during the current crackdown. they accused mr sigarchi of a string of crimes against iranian state, including espionage, insulting the founder of iran's islamic republic, ayatollah ruhollah khomenei, and current supreme leader ayatollah ali khamenei. mr sigarchi's lawyer labelled the revolutionary court ""illegal and incompetent"" and called for a retrial in a public court.  mr sigarchi was sentenced one day after an online campaign highlighted his case in a day of action in defence of bloggers around the world.  the committee to protect bloggers designated 22 february 2005 as free mojtaba and arash day. around 10,000 people visited the campaign's website during the day. about 12% of users were based in iran, the campaign's director told the bbc news website. curt hopkins said mr sigarchi's sentence would not dent the resolve of bloggers joining the campaign to help highlight the case.

"solutions to net security fears  fake bank e-mails, or phishing, and stories about id theft are damaging the potential of using the net for online commerce, say e-business experts.  trust in online security is falling as a result. almost 70% of those asked in a poll said that net firms are not doing enough to protect people. the survey of more than 1,000 people reported that 43% were not willing to hand over personal information online. it is worrying for shopaholics and firms who want to exploit the net. more people are becoming aware of online security issues but they have little confidence that companies are doing enough to counter the threats, said security firm rsa, which carried out the poll. an estimated 12 million britons now use the net as a way of managing their financial affairs. security experts say that scare stories and the vulnerabilities dogging e-commerce and e-banking are being taken seriously - by banks in particular.  ""i don't think the threat is overplayed,"" barry beal, global security manager for capgemini, told the bbc news website. he added: ""the challenge for banks is to provide the customer with something that improves security but balances that with usability."" ensuring extra security measures are in place protects them too, as well as the individual, and it is up to both parties to make sure they do what is necessary to prevent fraud, he said. ""card issuers will keep us informed of types of attacks and what procedure to take to protect ourselves. if we do that, they will indemnify us,"" he said. many believe using login details like usernames and passwords are simply not good enough anymore though. one of the biggest challenges to improving security online is how to authenticate an individual's identity. several security companies have developed methods which complement or replace passwords, which are easily compromised and easy to forget. last year, a street survey found that more than 70% of people would reveal their password for a bar of chocolate.  on average, people have to remember four different passwords. some resort to using the same one for all their online accounts. those who use several passwords often write them down and hide them in a desk or in a document on their computer. in a separate survey by rsa, 80% said they were fed up with passwords and would like a better way to login to work computer systems. for many, the ideal is a single online identity that can be validated once with a series of passwords and questions, or some biometric measurement like a fingerprint or iris scan with a token like a smartcard.  activcard is just one of the many companies, like rsa security, which has been trying to come up with just that. rsa has a deal with internet provider aol that lets people pay monthly for a one-time passcode generation service. users get a physical token which automatically generates a code which stays active for 60 seconds. many companies use a token-based method already for employees to access networks securely already. activcard's method is more complex. it is currently trailing its one-time passcode generation technology with uk banks. steve ash, from activcard, told the bbc news website there are two parts to the process of identification. the most difficult is to ascertain whether an individual is who they say they are when they are online.  ""the end solution is to provide a method where you combine something the user knows with something they have and present those both."" the method it has developed makes use of the chip embedded in bank cards and a special card reader which can generate unique codes that are active for a specified amount of time. this can be adjusted at any time and can be active for as little as 30 seconds before it changes. it combines that with usual usernames and passwords, as well as other security questions. ""you take the card, put it in the reader, enter your pin number, and a code is given. ""if you wanted then to transfer funds, for instance, you would have to have the code to authorise the transaction."" the clever bit happens back at the bank's secure servers. the code is validated by the bank's systems, matching the information they expect with the customer's unique key. ""each individual gets a key which is unique to them. it is a 2048-bit long number that is virtually impossible to crack,"" said mr ash. it means that in a typical security attack, explains mr ash, even if password information is captured by a scammer using keystroke software or just through spoof websites, they need the passcode. ""by the time they go back [to use the information], the code has expired, so they can't prove who they are,"" according to mr ash. in the next few years, mr ash predicts that this kind of method will be commonplace before we see biometric authentication that is acceptable for widespread use. ""pcs will have readers built into them, the cost of readers will be very cheap, and more people will have the cards."" the gadgets we carry around, like personal digital assistants (pdas) and mobiles, could also have integrated card reader technology in them. ""the pda or phone method is a possible alternative as people are always carrying phones around,"" he said.","more people are becoming aware of online security issues but they have little confidence that companies are doing enough to counter the threats, said security firm rsa, which carried out the poll.the method it has developed makes use of the chip embedded in bank cards and a special card reader which can generate unique codes that are active for a specified amount of time.activcard is just one of the many companies, like rsa security, which has been trying to come up with just that.almost 70% of those asked in a poll said that net firms are not doing enough to protect people.""by the time they go back [to use the information], the code has expired, so they can't prove who they are,"" according to mr ash.trust in online security is falling as a result.it means that in a typical security attack, explains mr ash, even if password information is captured by a scammer using keystroke software or just through spoof websites, they need the passcode.in a separate survey by rsa, 80% said they were fed up with passwords and would like a better way to login to work computer systems.one of the biggest challenges to improving security online is how to authenticate an individual's identity.the survey of more than 1,000 people reported that 43% were not willing to hand over personal information online.several security companies have developed methods which complement or replace passwords, which are easily compromised and easy to forget.for many, the ideal is a single online identity that can be validated once with a series of passwords and questions, or some biometric measurement like a fingerprint or iris scan with a token like a smartcard.""the pda or phone method is a possible alternative as people are always carrying phones around,"" he said.it combines that with usual usernames and passwords, as well as other security questions.ensuring extra security measures are in place protects them too, as well as the individual, and it is up to both parties to make sure they do what is necessary to prevent fraud, he said.the code is validated by the bank's systems, matching the information they expect with the customer's unique key.he added: ""the challenge for banks is to provide the customer with something that improves security but balances that with usability.""it is a 2048-bit long number that is virtually impossible to crack,"" said mr ash.""you take the card, put it in the reader, enter your pin number, and a code is given."

"'strong dollar' call halts slide  the us dollar's slide against the euro and yen has halted after us treasury secretary john snow said a strong dollar was ""in america's interest"".  but analysts said any gains are likely to be short-lived as problems with the us economy were still significant. they also pointed out that positive comments apart, president george w bush's administration had done little to stop the dollar's slide. a weak dollar helps boost exports and narrow the current account deficit. the dollar was trading at $1.2944 against the euro at 2100gmt, still close to the $1.3006 record level set on 10 november. against the japanese yen, it was trading at 105.28 yen, after hitting a seven-month low of 105.17 earlier in the day.  policy makers in europe have called the dollar's slide ""brutal"" and have blamed the strength of the euro for dampening economic growth. however, it is unclear whether ministers would issue a declaration aimed at curbing the euro's rise at a monthly meeting of eurozone ministers late on monday. higher growth in europe is regarded by us officials as a way the huge us current account deficit - that has been weighing on the dollar - could be reduced. mr snow who is currently in dublin at the start of a four-nation eu visit, has applauded ireland's introduction of lower taxes and deregulation which have helped boost growth. ""the eurozone is growing below its potential. when a major part of the global economy is below potential there are negative consequences... for the citizens of those economies... and for their trading partners,"" he said. mr snow's comments may have helped shore up the dollar on monday, but he was careful to qualify his statement.  ""our basic policy, of course, is to let open, competitive markets set the values,"" he explained. ""markets are driven by fundamentals and towards fundamentals."" us officials have also said that other economies need to grow, so the us is not the main global growth engine. economists say that the fundamentals, or key indicators, of the us economy are looking far from rosy. domestic consumer demand is cooling, and heavy spending by president bush has pushed the budget deficit to a record $427bn (£230bn). the current account deficit, meanwhile, hit a record $166bn in the second quarter of 2004. for many analysts, a weaker dollar is here to stay. ""no end is in sight,"" said carsten fritsch, a strategist at commerzbank . ""it is only a matter of time until the euro reaches $1.30."" some analysts maintain the us is secretly happy with a lower dollar which helps makes its exports cheaper in europe, thus boosting its economy.","the us dollar's slide against the euro and yen has halted after us treasury secretary john snow said a strong dollar was ""in america's interest"".higher growth in europe is regarded by us officials as a way the huge us current account deficit - that has been weighing on the dollar - could be reduced.us officials have also said that other economies need to grow, so the us is not the main global growth engine.the dollar was trading at $1.2944 against the euro at 2100gmt, still close to the $1.3006 record level set on 10 november.some analysts maintain the us is secretly happy with a lower dollar which helps makes its exports cheaper in europe, thus boosting its economy.but analysts said any gains are likely to be short-lived as problems with the us economy were still significant.a weak dollar helps boost exports and narrow the current account deficit.when a major part of the global economy is below potential there are negative consequences... for the citizens of those economies... and for their trading partners,"" he said.economists say that the fundamentals, or key indicators, of the us economy are looking far from rosy.mr snow's comments may have helped shore up the dollar on monday, but he was careful to qualify his statement."
"the future in your pocket  if you are a geek or gadget fan, the next 12 months look like they are going to be a lot of fun.  the relentless pace of development in the hi-tech world and rampant competition in many of its sectors, particularly among mobile phone firms, all suggests that 2005 is going to be a very good year. to begin with, 2005 will be the year that third-generation (3g) mobile phones become inescapable. the 3 network launched in 2003, vodafone launched its consumer service in november, orange followed in early december and t-mobile and o2 are due to launch in 2005. the main result of these launches will likely be a slew of good deals for consumers as operators try to poach new customers from rivals and convince existing users to trade up.  already the extra capacity in 3g networks lets 3 offer good deals on voice calls at rates that will probably have to be matched by the other operators. but the shift in technology and low cost of voice calls means that operators lose a significant chunk of their revenue. ""show me an operator that believes their voice business can sustain them, and i'll write their obituary"" said niel ransom, chief technology officer at alcatel.  instead operators are likely to push all other things that 3g phones can do such as video messaging and other multimedia capabilities. already camera phones look set to challenge digital cameras and are likely to win more fans as multi-megapixel devices go on sale. but 3g will not have everything its own way. it will face competition from emerging technologies such as wimax. this wireless technology can boost data transmission speeds up to 75 megabits per second and works over distances of up to 30 miles. kent is likely to be the site of the uk's first wimax network which is due to go live in 2005 and it could be the way that rural areas get high-speed net access. analyst firm telecom view predicts that wimax will steal a lot of market share from 3g and will be a clear winner. bob larribeau, principal analyst at telecom view, said the better return on investment offered by technologies such as wimax could dent the possible returns of 3g networks. and the growing ubiquity of wi-fi must not be forgotten either. the technology is popping up in more places than ever and its wider use is only held back by the price differences across countries and suppliers.  moves to unite mobile and fixed phones look set to get more emphasis in 2005 too.  for a start, bt looks set to roll out its bluephone project during the next 12 months. the service revolves around a hybrid device that uses the mobile networks when you are out and about but switches back to the fixed line when you are at home. fixed line phones will also start to get much more serious competition from a technology that has the formidable name of voice over ip (voip). voip routes calls via the net instead of the fixed line phone network. anyone with a broadband connection, which is now more than 50% of the uk's net using population, can use voip and could slash their monthly phone bills if they used it. telecommunications regulator ofcom has declared 056 to be the area code for voip calls and 2005 is likely to see a lot more consumer-focused voip call services starting up. home broadband services will also start to increase in speed as dwindling numbers of new users signing force the pace of competition. if 2004 has been the year of the portable music player, they 2005 looks like it will be the year of the portable media player. motorola has just announced a deal with apple to produce a phone that works with the itunes service and other hybrid gadgets that sport a big memory and lots of other functions will become commonplace. the pace of advancement in storage media will continue mean that the cost per megabyte of memory will plummet. some of those devices will sport huge hard drives letting you store more data than you ever wanted or knew you had. convergence could mean that single-function devices start to dwindle in number. instead every gadget will be able to do almost anything and communicate almost any way you want. the only downside is that consumers will face a series of tough choices as they are confronted by a bewildering array of gadgets each with an enormous numbers of features and vast data holding capacities. but that is the kind of problem most gadget fans can live with.","fixed line phones will also start to get much more serious competition from a technology that has the formidable name of voice over ip (voip).voip routes calls via the net instead of the fixed

"clarke plans migrant point scheme  anyone planning to move to the uk will have to pass a test to prove they can contribute to the country, home secretary charles clarke has said.  he is proposing a points system similar to australia's but would avoid the quota system planned by the tories. mr clarke, who will unveil his plans on monday, said economic migration helped the uk but ""needed proper policing"". the lib dems say they will look at his plans, but tory liam fox said his party offered a ""clear choice"" on the issue. the conservative party co-chairman said the british electorate had a choice between a labour government that had ""done nothing for eight years and will not set a limit"" on immigration and a tory one that would impose quotas.  the home secretary said, by 2008, he wanted everyone given a visa and entering the uk to have their fingerprints taken, to ""ensure we can know everybody who is in the country"". speaking on bbc one's breakfast with frost, he said ""economic migrants are of great value to this country"", but stressed that proper policing was needed to ensure that they do not become a ""burden on society"". he said: ""we will establish a system ... which looks at the skills, talents and abilities of people seeking to come and work in this country, and ensures that when they come here they have a job and can contribute to the economy of the country.""  the home secretary, whose five-year blueprint for immigration and asylum is expected to be published on monday, also rejected claims that the immigration debate encouraged bigotry. ""the issue of who does come into this country, and whether they are entitled to be in this country, who does settle here, how we have border controls, is a perfectly legitimate aspect of public debate,"" he said. liberal democrat home affairs spokesman mark oaten said: ""whilst it is good that labour has rejected the tory idea of quotas on asylum, the jury is still out on the home office's ability to deliver a fair and efficient asylum system.""  mr howard has said britain should take its fair share of the world's ""genuine refugees"". but he claims the current asylum system is being abused - and with it britain's generosity. trevor phillips, chairman of the commission for racial equality, called on mr clarke to denounce the suggestion britain's hospitality was being tested by immigration. ""tell that to the 44,000 doctors in the nhs and the 70,000 nurses without whom we would really see what pressure on the health service means,"" he said. ""ditto the teachers, from south africa, australia, jamaica, who are reducing the sizes of our classes and schools."" the refugee council said mr howard's proposals would mean there would be no safe haven in the uk.","anyone planning to move to the uk will have to pass a test to prove they can contribute to the country, home secretary charles clarke has said.liberal democrat home affairs spokesman mark oaten said: ""whilst it is good that labour has rejected the tory idea of quotas on asylum, the jury is still out on the home office's ability to deliver a fair and efficient asylum system.""mr clarke, who will unveil his plans on monday, said economic migration helped the uk but ""needed proper policing"".the refugee council said mr howard's proposals would mean there would be no safe haven in the uk.the home secretary said, by 2008, he wanted everyone given a visa and entering the uk to have their fingerprints taken, to ""ensure we can know everybody who is in the country"".he said: ""we will establish a system ... which looks at the skills, talents and abilities of people seeking to come and work in this country, and ensures that when they come here they have a job and can contribute to the economy of the country.""""the issue of who does come into this country, and whether they are entitled to be in this country, who does settle here, how we have border controls, is a perfectly legitimate aspect of public debate,"" he said."
"local net tv takes off in austria  an austrian village is testing technology that could represent the future of television.  the people of engerwitzdorf are filming, editing and producing their own regional news channel. the channel covers local politics, sports, events and anything that residents want to film and are prepared to upload for others to watch on pcs. the pilot has been so successful that telekom austria is now considering setting up other projects elsewhere.  ""it's growing unbelievably fast,"" said rudolf fischer, head of telekom austria's fixed line division. the trial of buntes fernsehen (multi-coloured tv) was started in late 2004 and creates a net-based tv station run by the 8,000 residents of engerwitzdorf. the hardware and software to turn video footage into edited programmes has been provided by telekom austria but this equipment, following training, has been turned over to the villagers. any video programme created by the villagers is uploaded to a buntes fernsehen portal that lets people browse and download what they want to watch. most people watch the tv on their home pc and a broadband connection is needed to get broadcast quality programmes. in the first four months of the project villagers have created 60 films and put together regular reports on local news items. ""they have adopted it very quickly,"" said mr fischer. ""they like the possibility to create their own content and see what's going on in the area."" ""it's kind of the democratisation of local tv,"" he said, ""because none of the bigger broadcasters would ever do anything like this for that region."" the buntes fernsehen project has been such a success that telekom austria is now considering setting up other schemes in similarly rural areas. mr fischer said it was taking the roll-out to other areas slowly because of the work involved in setting up the scheme, getting backers from local government and educating people how to make programmes. the engerwitzdorf scheme is an outgrowth of telekom austria's online tv channel aon which lets people watch programmes on their pc. aon streams a couple of live channels, plus sports, news and music programmes on to the net and has a pay-for-download section that lets people watch what they want when they want to watch it. in october a larger tv-on-demand project is due to launch in vienna that will let people download many programmes from the net.","the engerwitzdorf scheme is an outgrowth of telekom austria's online tv channel aon which lets people watch programmes on their pc.any video programme created by the villagers is uploaded to a buntes fernsehen portal that lets people browse and download what they want to watch.aon streams a couple of live channels, plus sports, news and music programmes on to the net and has a pay-for-download section that lets people watch what they want when they want to watch it.mr fischer said it was taking the roll-out to other areas slowly because of the work involved in setting up the scheme, getting backers from local government and educating people how to make programmes.the buntes fernsehen project has been such a success that telekom austria is now considering setting up other schemes in similarly rural areas.the pilot has been so successful that telekom austria is now considering setting up other projects elsewhere.in october a larger tv-on-demand project is due to launch in vienna that will let people download many programmes from the net.most people watch the tv on their home pc and a broadband connection is needed to get broadcast quality programmes."
"ukip could sue veritas defectors  the uk independence party could take legal action to unseat two london assembly members who defected to robert kilroy silk's veritas party.  damian hockney, now veritas deputy leader, and peter hulme-cross were elected in 2004 on the list system. the party argues the pair should give up their seats as they won them as ukip representatives, not as individuals. mr hockney said the law was clear that those elected on a list who quit their party should keep their seats. ukip chairman petrina holdsworth urged the men to step down from the gla in a letter.  she said: ""the party has taken legal advice and it is clear that we could take legal proceedings against you which could result in the return of our seats and/or damages against you. ""we would however like you to be given an opportunity to reflect on what you have done, to restore your own credibility with the electorate and return the seats to the party which won them fair and square at the last election."" mr hockney said the law worked in exactly the same way for the gla as it did for other electoral list systems. ""the greater london act is clear that if someone resigns who was elected on a list, their party whip the seat belongs to them and not the party."" he said mr hulme-cross and himself had no intention of resigning and added that they felt that it was ukip who were not being true to the electorate. he accused the party of signing up to a deal with the tories in europe, rather than sticking to an independent stance. but the claim was denied by ukip spokesman, who said: ""mr hockney's accusations are like his sense of political morals - empty."" veritas was formed by mr kilroy-silk earlier this month after he quit ukip following an unsuccessful bid to take over as leader.","mr hockney said the law was clear that those elected on a list who quit their party should keep their seats.""the greater london act is clear that if someone resigns who was elected on a list, their party whip the seat belongs to them and not the party.""he said mr hulme-cross and himself had no intention of resigning and added that they felt that it was ukip who were not being true to the electorate.the party argues the pair should give up their seats as they won them as ukip representatives, not as individuals.she said: ""the party has taken legal advice and it is clear that we could take legal proceedings against you which could result in the return of our seats and/or damages against you.veritas was formed by mr kilroy-silk earlier this month after he quit ukip following an unsuccessful bid to take over as leader."
"toxic web links help virus spread  virus writers have begun using the power of the web to spread their malicious wares.  a windows virus called bofra is turning infected machines into distributors of its malicious code. those clicking on the poisoned links in e-mail messages sent out by infected machines may fall victim to the virus. the trick is being used to prevent the progam being caught by anti-virus software that combs through code contained in e-mail attachments.  the virus that uses this trick is called bofra and the first member of the family of worms appeared on 10 november. they exploit a windows vulnerability that was discovered only a few days earlier.  like many other recent viruses, bofra plunders the address book in microsoft outlook for e-mail addresses and scours other files on an infected machine for fresh target addresses. the virus uses its own mail sending software to despatch e-mail messages to potential victims but, unlike many other recent viruses, does not itself travel via mail. instead the body of the mail messages sent out contain fake weblinks that, when clicked on, connect back to the machine that distributed that e-mail. essentially, bofra turns infected machines into small web servers that happily dole out copies of the virus. the messages try to trick people into clicking on the links by promising pornographic videos and images or by posing as payment confirmation for a paypal transaction.  copies of the messages seen by the bbc news website had bright yellow and green backgrounds. those clicking on the links will inadvertently download the bofra virus which will then start searching for new addresses to send itself to. filtering firm clearswift said this tactic of creating thousands of mini web servers was designed to help the virus spread quickly and avoid attempts to shut it down. in the past other malicious programs have relied on a single web server that downloads viral code to target machines. shutting down this central server usually stops the virus spreading.  clearswift said that fact that no viral code travels in the e-mail messages sent out by machines infected by bofra could hamper effects to limit its spread. finnish anti-virus firm f-secure said that, so far, it had not seen many copies of the bofra virus and its variants in circulation.  tim warner, spokesman for anti-virus firm finjan, said: ""you have people getting very creative now to deliver the virus and get it propagating."" mr warner said organisations needed to prepare deep defences to keep out the modern form of malicious mobile code. ""most firms have secured their e-mail gateway,"" said mr warner, ""but the irony is that most of them let malicious content through the web gateways."" he said behavioural systems that monitor what users do can help to spot when viruses have penetrated organisations and have started hunting for other victims. the bofra family of viruses, which were originally thought to be offshoots of the mydoom bug, can infect machines running windows 2000, 95, 98, me, nt, xp and server 2003. users running windows xp that have applied the sp2 update are not vulnerable to the loophole that bofra exploits.","a windows virus called bofra is turning infected machines into distributors of its malicious code.those clicking on the poisoned links in e-mail messages sent out by infected machines may fall victim to the virus.clearswift said that fact that no viral code travels in the e-mail messages sent out by machines infected by bofra could hamper effects to limit its spread.essentially, bofra turns infected machines into small web servers that happily dole out copies of the virus.finnish anti-virus firm f-secure said that, so far, it had not seen many copies of the bofra virus and its variants in circulation.filtering firm clearswift said this tactic of creating thousands of mini web servers was designed to help the virus spread quickly and avoid attempts to shut it down.those clicking on the links will inadvertently download the bofra virus which will then start searching for new addresses to send itself to.the virus uses its own mail sending software to despatch e-mail messages to potential victims but, unlike many other recent viruses, does not itself travel via mail.the virus that uses this trick is called bofra and the first member of the family of worms appeared on 10 november.the bofra family of viruses, which were originally thought to be offshoots of the mydoom bug, can infect machines running windows 2000, 95, 98, me, nt, xp and server 2003."
"labour's 'eu propaganda'  a ""taxpayer subsidised propaganda exercise"" on the eu is being used to lull the british public into a false sense of security, say the tories.  shadow foreign secretary michael ancram told mps a new white paper was part of trying to soften up opinion ahead of the referendum on the eu constitution. his claims were denied by foreign secretary jack straw, who accused the tories of ""running scared"" of debate. eu cooperation would help get better uk immigration controls, he argued.  mr straw used thursday's commons debate to launch the new white paper on the prospects for the eu in 2005. security, stability and prosperity would be the key themes when the uk took over the chairmanship of the eu in july, said mr straw. africa and climate change would also feature highly. he said the uk was trying to ensure future eu budgets were limited to 1% of europe's economic output and were spent ""where it adds most value"". mr straw promised to continue to ensure the uk's budget rebate, secured in 1984 by margaret thatcher, was ""fully justified"". ""we, like all other countries, have a veto on any changes proposed in this area,"" he said.  mr ancram condemned the document, which the foreign office says has cost about £2,500 to design, print and deliver. ""isn't the reason that the government is now involved in a taxpayer subsidised propaganda exercise to try to sell the new eu to the country in advance of the forthcoming referendum and general election?,"" he asked. the tory spokesman also criticised the government for claiming the eu constitution would make europe easier to understand. ""the government, last week, had to publish a commentary of 500 pages to try and explain this 'easy and simple' constitution to the british people,"" he said. ""who are they trying to kid?"" the proposed question for the constitution referendum is: ""should the united kingdom approve the treaty establishing a constitution for the european union?"" the electoral commission on thursday said it was satisfied the question was easy to understand. the government has suggested the referendum on the constitution could take place in spring 2006, with the tories set to campaign for a ""no"" vote.  mr ancram said ministers were prolonging uncertainty by putting the vote off until the latest date possible. the foreign secretary hit back by saying tory attitudes to europe had helped keep the party out of power for more than a decade. mr straw argued cooperation with european partners could bring a ""level playing field"" on immigration and asylum controls. ""you are setting your face against all of these things,"" he added. for the liberal democrats, sir menzies campbell said the uk should not ignore the need to reform the eu common agricultural policy. change was particularly important for developing countries wanting access to markets, he argued. sir menzies was among those worried about plans, backed by the uk, to lift the arms embargo imposed on china after the tiananmen square massacre. mr straw said no decisions had been taken - chinese human rights had improved but not by enough.","security, stability and prosperity would be the key themes when the uk took over the chairmanship of the eu in july, said mr straw.shadow foreign secretary michael ancram told mps a new white paper was part of trying to soften up opinion ahead of the referendum on the eu constitution.he said the uk was trying to ensure future eu budgets were limited to 1% of europe's economic output and were spent ""where it adds most value"".mr straw used thursday's commons debate to launch the new white paper on the prospects for the eu in 2005.the tory spokesman also criticised the government for claiming the eu constitution would make europe easier to understand.eu cooperation would help get better uk immigration controls, he argued.the electoral commission on thursday said it was satisfied the question was easy to understand.mr straw said no decisions had been taken - chinese human rights had improved but not by enough.for the liberal democrats, sir menzies campbell said the uk should not ignore the need to reform the eu common agricultural policy.mr straw promised to continue to ensure the uk's budget rebate, secured in 1984 by margaret thatcher, was ""fully justified"".mr straw argued cooperation with european partners could bring a ""level playing field"" on immigration and asylum controls."
"safin cool on wimbledon  newly-crowned australian open champion marat safin has ruled out any chance of winning wimbledon in the future.  after losing in round one last year, safin said he had ""given up"" on wimbledon and winning his second grand slam title has not changed his mind. ""i'll play, but with no expectations. i feel like i can't waste my time, my energy on that surface,"" he said. ""some people, they cannot play on clay. some people, they cannot play on a hard court. me, i can't play on grass."" however, safin is hopeful that winning the australian open will give him the belief he needs to win more grand slam titles.

"woolf murder sentence rethink  plans to give murderers lighter sentences if they plead guilty have been watered down.  there was an outcry three months ago when the sentencing guidelines council - led by lord woolf - published its proposals for england and wales. it had suggested judges should reduce sentences by a third for murderers who confessed at the earliest opportunity. but that has now been changed to one-sixth, with no reduction for those killers given a ""whole life tariff"". at the time lord woolf, the lord chief justice, had said the one third reduction would only be in extraordinary circumstances - for example, if people gave themselves up before their crime had even been detected. the guidelines were to recognise the need to spare victims and witnesses the trauma of going to court where possible, by allowing lighter sentences for guilty pleas and co-operation, he said.  but director of the victims of crime trust, norman brennan, accused lord woolf of having an ""arrogant contempt for victims of crime and the law-abiding public"". the national association of probation officers said the move would be ""political suicide"". in revised proposals from the sentencing guidelines council (sgc), the section on murder said possible reductions would have to be ""weighed carefully"" by a judge so they did not lead to ""an inappropriately short sentence"". where it was appropriate to reduce the minimum term having regard to a plea of guilty, the maximum reduction would be one sixth, and should never exceed five years, it said.  in a statement issued on wednesday lord woolf said: ""i have no doubt that being able to call on the diverse backgrounds and experiences of all those that serve on the sgc has vastly improved the final guidelines. ""i am confident, as a result, that judges will be better placed to deliver sentences which are effective both as punishments and deterrents to offending and reoffending."" director of public prosecutions, ken macdonald qc, who sits on the sgc, said the principle of discounting sentences to offenders for early guilty pleas is set down by parliament. ""what the new guideline on reduced sentences for guilty pleas does is increase the chances of convicting the guilty by bringing clarity to this process.

"a decade of good website design  the web looks very different today than it did 10 years ago.  back in 1994, yahoo had only just launched, most websites were text-based and amazon, google and ebay had yet to appear. but, says usability guru dr jakob nielsen, some things have stayed constant in that decade, namely the principles of what makes a site easy to use. dr nielsen has looked back at a decade of work on usability and considered whether the 34 core guidelines drawn up back then are relevant to the web of today. ""roughly 80% of the things we found 10 years ago are still an issue today,"" he said. ""some have gone away because users have changed and 10% have changed because technology has changed.""  some design crimes, such as splash screens that get between a user and the site they are trying to visit, and web designers indulging their artistic urges have almost disappeared, said dr nielsen.  ""but there's great stability on usability concerns,"" he told the bbc news website. dr nielsen said the basic principles of usability, centring around ease of use and clear thinking about a site's total design, were as important as ever. ""it's necessary to be aware of these things as issues because they remain as such,"" he said. they are still important because the net has not changed as much as people thought it would. ""a lot of people thought that design and usability was only a temporary problem because broadband was taking off,"" he said. ""but there are a very small number of cases where usability issues go away because you have broadband.""  dr nielsen said the success of sites such as google, amazon, ebay and yahoo showed that close attention to design and user needs was important. ""those four sites are extremely profitable and extremely successful,"" said dr nielsen, adding that they have largely defined commercial success on the net.  ""all are based on user empowerment and make it easy for people to do things on the internet,"" he said. ""they are making simple but powerful tools available to the user. ""none of them have a fancy or glamorous look,"" he added, declaring himself surprised that these sites have not been more widely copied. in the future, dr nielsen believes that search engines will play an even bigger part in helping people get to grips with the huge amount of information online. ""they are becoming like the operating system to the internet,"" he said. but, he said, the fact that they are useful now does not meant that they could not do better. currently, he said, search sites did not do a very good job of describing the information that they return in response to queries. often people had to look at a website just to judge whether it was useful or not. tools that watch the behaviour of people on websites to see what they actually find useful could also help refine results. research by dr nielsen shows that people are getting more sophisticated in their use of search engines. the latest statistics on how many words people use on search engines shows that, on average, they use 2.2 terms. in 1994 only 1.3 words were used. ""i think it's amazing that we have seen a doubling in a 10-year period of those search terms,"" said dr nielsen.  you can hear more from jakob nielsen and web design on the bbc world service programme, go digital","dr nielsen said the success of sites such as google, amazon, ebay and yahoo showed that close attention to design and user needs was important.dr nielsen said the basic principles of usability, centring around ease of use and clear thinking about a site's total design, were as important as ever.some design crimes, such as splash screens that get between a user and the site they are trying to visit, and web designers indulging their artistic urges have almost disappeared, said dr nielsen.""i think it's amazing that we have seen a doubling in a 10-year period of those search terms,"" said dr nielsen.""all are based on user empowerment and make it easy for people to do things on the internet,"" he said.research by dr nielsen shows that people are getting more sophisticated in their use of search engines.but, says usability guru dr jakob nielsen, some things have stayed constant in that decade, namely the principles of what makes a site easy to use.""a lot of people thought that design and usability was only a temporary problem because broadband was taking off,"" he said.""roughly 80% of the things we found 10 years ago are still an issue today,"" he said.""those four sites are extremely profitable and extremely successful,"" said dr nielsen, adding that they have largely defined commercial success on the net.dr nielsen has looked back at a decade of work on usability and considered whether the 34 core guidelines drawn up back then are relevant to the web of today.often people had to look at a website just to judge whether it was useful or not."

"eu software patent law faces axe  the european parliament has thrown out a bill that would have allowed software to be patented.  politicians unanimously rejected the bill and now it must go through another round of consultation if it is to have a chance of becoming law. during consultation the software patents bill could be substantially re-drafted or even scrapped. the bill was backed by some hi-tech firms, saying they needed protections it offered to make research worthwhile.  hugo lueders, european director for public policy at comptia, an umbrella organization for technology companies, said only when intellectual property was adequately protected would european inventors prosper. he said the benefits of the bill had been obscured by special interest groups which muddied debate over the rights and wrongs of software patents. other proponents of the bill said it was a good compromise that avoided the excesses of the american system which allows the patenting of business practices as well as software. but opponents of the bill said that it could stifle innovation, be abused by firms keen to protect existing monopolies and could hamper the growth of the open source movement. the proposed law had a troubled passage through the european parliament. its progress was delayed twice when polish meps rejected plans to adopt it. also earlier this month the influential european legal affairs committee (juri) said the law should be re-drafted after it failed to win the support of meps. to become law both the european parliament and a qualified majority of eu states have to approve of the draft wording of the bill. the latest rejection means that now the bill on computer inventions must go back to the eu for re-consideration.",the european parliament has thrown out a bill that would have allowed software to be patented.to become law both the european parliament and a qualified majority of eu states have to approve of the draft wording of the bill.during consultation the software patents bill could be substantially re-drafted or even scrapped.politicians unanimously rejected the bill and now it must go through another round of consultation if it is to have a chance of becoming law.other proponents of the bill said it was a good compromise that avoided the excesses of the american system which allows the patenting of business practices as well as software.he said the benefits of the bill had been obscured by special interest groups which muddied debate over the rights and wrongs of software patents.
"hollywood hunts hits at sundance  the sundance film festival, the movie industry's top destination for uncovering the next independent hits and new talent, opens on thursday.  the event will see screen executives decamp from hollywood to park city, utah, for 11 days to search for low-key movies that could make it big in 2005. open water, napoleon dynamite, garden state and super-size me were all snapped up at last year's festival. but stars like keanu reeves and pierce brosnan also have films showing there. the festival is being opened by a screening of quirky comedy happy endings, starring former friends actress lisa kudrow and maggie gyllenhaal, on thursday.  kudrow's friends co-star, david schwimmer, plays a divorced drunkard in duane hopwood, while brosnan stars as a hit man in comedy the matador. keanu reeves appears in coming-of-age tale thumbsucker while kevin costner and michael keaton are among the other big names whose films are involved. robert redford founded sundance in 1981 and it has gone on to showcase future successes such as reservoir dogs, the blair witch project and the full monty. but it has received criticism that it has become more commercial and mainstream over the years. ""as much as the press argues that sundance has completely changed, it hasn't changed that much,"" festival director geoffrey gilmore said.

"emi shares hit by profit warning  shares in music giant emi have sunk by more than 16% after the firm issued a profit warning following disappointing sales and delays to two album releases.  emi said music sales for the year to march will fall 8-9% from the year before, with profits set to be 15% lower than analysts had expected. it blamed poor sales since christmas and delays to the releases of new albums by coldplay and gorillaz. by 1200 gmt on monday, emi shares were down 16.2% at 235.75 pence.  emi said two major albums scheduled for release before the end of the financial year in march - one by coldplay and one by gorillaz - have now had their release dates put back.  ""emi music's sales, particularly re-orders, in january have also been lower than anticipated and this is expected to continue through february and march,"" the company added. ""therefore, for the full year, at constant currency, emi music's sales are now expected to be 8% to 9% lower than the prior year."" the company said it expected profits to be about £138m ($259.8m). alain levy, chairman and chief executive of emi music, described the performance as ""disappointing"", but added that he remained optimistic over future trends in the industry.

"retail sales show festive fervour  uk retail sales were better than expected in november as christmas shoppers began their seasonal flock to the high street, figures show.  the office for national statistics (ons) said retail sales rose 0.6% on the month and 6.1% on the year. but the figures, along with this week's inflation report, could trigger another interest rate rise in the new year. however, recent data from the british retail consortium showed a 0.2% slip in high street sales during november.  the ons data confounded analyst expectations. many had expected sales to fall slightly in november as shoppers put off buying christmas presents until december. however, retailers' attempts to draw in the crowds may be behind november's unexpected rise in sales, they say. aggressive tactics, such as one-day discount sales adopted by stores such as marks & spencer, appear to have paid off. ""price discounting has certainly accounted for much of this because the value of retail sales hasn't grown as much as volumes,"" said investec economist david page. the figures sparked a rally for sterling as the data supported the view that it is too early to assume that base rates have peaked.","however, recent data from the british retail consortium showed a 0.2% slip in high street sales during november.uk retail sales were better than expected in november as christmas shoppers began their seasonal flock to the high street, figures show.the office for national statistics (ons) said retail sales rose 0.6% on the month and 6.1% on the year.many had expected sales to fall slightly in november as shoppers put off buying christmas presents until december."
"dvd copy protection strengthened  dvds will be harder to copy thanks to new anti-piracy measures devised by copy protection firm macrovision.  the pirated dvd market is enormous because current copy protection was hacked more than five years ago. macrovision says its new ripguard technology will thwart most, but not all, of the current dvd ripping (copying) programs used to pirate dvds. ""ripguard is designed to... reduce dvd ripping and the resulting supply of illegal peer to peer,"" said the firm. macrovision said the new technology will work in ""nearly all"" current dvd players when applied to the discs, but it did not specify how many machines could have a problem with ripguard. some bbc news website users have expressed concerns that the new technology will mean that dvds will not work on pcs running the operating system linux. the new technology will be welcomed by hollywood film studios which are increasingly relying on revenue from dvd sales.  the film industry has stepped up efforts to fight dvd piracy in the last 12 months, taking legal action against websites which offer pirated copies of dvd movies for download.  ""ultimately, we see ripguard dvd... evolving beyond anti-piracy, and towards enablement of legitimate online transactions, interoperability in tomorrow's digital home, and the upcoming high-definition formats,"" said steve weinstein, executive vice president and general manager of macrovision's entertainment technologies group. macrovision said ripguard would also prevent against ""rent, rip and return"" - where people would rent a dvd, copy it and then return the original. ripguard is expected to be rolled out on dvds from the middle of 2005, the company said. the new system works specifically to block most ripping programs - if used, those programs will now most likely crash, the company said. macrovision has said that rip guard can be updated if hackers find a way around the new anti-copying measures.","macrovision says its new ripguard technology will thwart most, but not all, of the current dvd ripping (copying) programs used to pirate dvds.macrovision said the new technology will work in ""nearly all"" current dvd players when applied to the discs, but it did not specify how many machines could have a problem with ripguard.macrovision said ripguard would also prevent against ""rent, rip and return"" - where people would rent a dvd, copy it and then return the original.dvds will be harder to copy thanks to new anti-piracy measures devised by copy protection firm macrovision.""ripguard is designed to... reduce dvd ripping and the resulting supply of illegal peer to peer,"" said the firm.the new system works specifically to block most ripping programs - if used, those programs will now most likely crash, the company said."

"broadband soars in 2004  if broadband were a jumbo jet, then 2003 would have seen it taxiing down the runway, firing up its engines and preparing for take-off. but this year has seen it soar.  in the spring it literally took to the skies as lufthansa and british airways trialled it on flights. this perhaps said more about how indispensable people were beginning to perceive the technology, rather than how useful sky-high broadband would actually be. it was flying high and by the autumn, five million britons had signed up for high-speed net access at home.  such enthusiasm is unlikely to dampen any time soon and experts predict that by the end of next year the numbers will have risen to more than eight million, or more than 30% of homes. the two key factors in whetting people's appetite were falling prices and a huge marketing push. when operators such as bt and telewest offered standard 512k broadband for less than £20 at the beginning of the year, it was as if an invisible barrier had been breached - broadband had truly gone mass market. a feeding frenzy followed as firms vied for eyeballs in a price war reminiscent of that following the mass market take-up of dial-up. broadband for less than £10 was even touted by some firms, although such a low price raised eyebrows among more established companies questioning how they are able to sustain such business models.  for those who became broadbanders in 2004 there was no turning back and the days of waiting for the modem to kick in began to seem as outdated an idea as a jungle without celebrities. the rest of the world was also falling in love with the benefits of fast internet access, to the tune of 100 million connections worldwide by april, prompting research firm point topic to declare it one of the fastest growing technologies ever. by september, the number of broadband connections in the uk finally overtook dial-up and in december bt announced that it was making a new broadband connection every 10 seconds.  broadband was being mentioned on the 10 o'clock news and in the tabloids; the sun even carried a cartoon joke about it. but two of the most significant pieces of news for broadband were items that did not make the headlines. in may, bt quietly announced that it was shaving 70% off the cost of allowing other operators access to its telephone exchanges, so-called local loop unbundling. the vital local loop is the crucial link between telephone exchanges and homes. at the moment bt has a stranglehold on more than 80% of these lines making it the key voice in deciding what adsl products get into homes. with cheaper local loop unbundling, rivals to bt can offer faster services that will leave the broadband of today looking positively tortoise-like. it will mean the uk will finally catch up with countries such as france and the netherlands, where homes are routinely enjoying speeds of up to 15mb (megabits per second). and the major price fall means that, rather than just talk about it, companies are actually starting to get their own equipment into bt's exchanges. it may not seem that exciting but it is a remarkable transition given that just a few years ago the arguments over local loop unbundling bore more than a passing resemblance to the northern ireland peace talks - fraught, bitter and with no end in sight.  another big piece of news for broadband users in 2004 was the extension of bt's reach, meaning more than 95% of the population could get broadband, regardless of how far away from the exchange they lived.  there was a slight caveat for those wanting to upgrade to 1mbps broadband, they still have to live within six kilometres of a broadband-enabled exchange. for thousands frustrated by their inability to get the technology, the news meant they could finally join in. broadband is not just about fast access over the telephone and cable operators ntl and telewest also had a bumper year. the biggest news for them was increased speeds, introducing 2mb and 3mb services for users and offering a free upgrade to those on 512k. the cable operators are limited in their reach and it is perhaps testament to how big a deal local loop unbundling could become that even they are considering extending their range via this route. broadband can seem confusing for consumers, with the huge amount of operators offering so many different products, some with capped bandwidth and different length contracts and set-up fees. it is unlikely to get any less easy to understand in 2005 but remains a plane worth catching. as it gets faster and offers extras such as cheap telephone calls online, the only real thing to remember for the coming year is to enjoy the ride.","when operators such as bt and telewest offered standard 512k broadband for less than £20 at the beginning of the year, it was as if an invisible barrier had been breached - broadband had truly gone mass market.another big piece of news for broadband users in 2004 was the extension of bt's reach, meaning more than 95% of the population could get broadband, regardless of how far away from the exchange they lived.by september, the number of broadband connections in the uk finally overtook dial-up and in december bt announced that it was making a new broadband connection every 10 seconds.broadband is not just about fast access over the telephone and cable operators ntl and telewest also had a bumper year.in may, bt quietly announced that it was shaving 70% off the cost of allowing other operators access to its telephone exchanges, so-called local loop unbundling.broadband was being mentioned on the 10 o'clock news and in the tabloids;

"arsenal 'may seek full share listing'  arsenal vice-chairman david dein has said the club may consider seeking a full listing for its shares on the london stock exchange.  speaking at the soccerex football business forum in dubai, he said a full listing was ""one of the options"" for funding after the club moves to its new stadium. the club - which is currently listed on the smaller ofex share exchange - is due to move into its new 60,000-seater emirates stadium at ashburton grove for the start of the 2006/07 season. mr dein also warned the current level of tv coverage of the premiership may be reaching saturation level, with signs that match attendances have been dropping off in the first few months of this season.  when arsenal moves to its new stadium it will see its proportion of turnover from media earnings drop from 52% this season to 34% in two years' time. the club is hoping to increase matchday earnings from 29% to 40% of turnover, and has not ruled out other money-earning means, including a full share listing. ""when the new stadium opens we will go through a thorough financial review,"" mr dein said.  ""listing would be one option, but we are flexible and no decisions have been made on that issue yet. ""we want to be in the best financial health - maybe clubs can do it (listing), manchester united have been a success.""  mr dein said that, although television money and coverage had driven the english game forward in the past 10 years, he feared there might now be too many games being shown. since the formation of the premier league in season 1992/93, premiership clubs have seen their income from television soar. ""television has been the driving force over the past 10 years... but we must constantly improve if we want to remain as the world's leading league competition. ""we must monitor the quality of the product and ensure attendances do not decline, and we must balance that with the quantity of exposure on tv too. ""i think we have practically reached saturation point... sometimes i think less is more.""  the club is funding its move to ashburton grove through a number of sources, including debt from banks, from money it already has and will receive in coming years from sponsors, and from the sale of surplus property, including its highbury stadium. it is also looking to create new revenue streams from overseas markets, including asia.

"moya clinches cup for spain  spain won the davis cup for the second time in their history when carlos moya beat the usa's andy roddick in the fourth rubber in seville.  moya won 6-2 7-6 (7-1) 7-6 (7-5) to give the hosts an unassailable 3-1 lead with only one singles rubber remaining. roddick battled hard and had chances in the second set, but moya's clay-court expertise proved the difference. mardy fish beat tommy robredo 7-6 (8-6) 6-2 in the final dead rubber to cut spain's winning margin to 3-2. spain's only other davis cup title came in 2000, when they beat australia in barcelona. this time they chose to play the final in seville and the city's olympic stadium was revamped to allow for a record crowd for a competitve tennis event of 27,000 spectators. and the home fans gave vociferous support to their players, with 18-year-old nadal and moya winning both friday's singles rubbers. american twins mike and bob bryan gave the visitors hope with victory over juan carlos ferrero and tommy robredo in saturday's doubles. but it remained an uphill task for a us team far happier on hard courts than clay, and 1998 french open champion moya had too much for world number two roddick.

""i think we put up a better fight here than in paris two years ago,"" said roddick, who was on the us team which lost to france in the 2002 semi-finals at roland garros.

"new delay hits eu software laws  a fresh delay has hit controversial new european union rules which govern computer-based inventions.  the draft law was not adopted by eu ministers as planned at a brussels meeting on monday during which it was supposed to have been discussed. the fresh delay came after polish officials had raised concerns about the law for the second time in two months. critics say the law would favour large companies over small ones and could impact open-source software innovation. ""there was at one point the intention to put the item on today's agenda. but in the end we could not put it on,"" an eu spokesman told the reuters agency. he added that no date had been chosen for more discussion of the law.  in december, poland requested more time to consider the issue because it was concerned that the law could lead to the patenting of pure computer software. its ministers want to see the phrasing of the text of the directive on the patentability of computer-implemented inventions changed so that it excludes software patenting. poland is a large eu member, so its backing for the legislation is vital. the eu says the law would bring europe more in line with how such laws work in the us, but this has caused some angry debate amongst critics and supporters. in the us, the patenting of computer programs and internet business methods is permitted. this means that the us-based amazon.com holds a patent for its ""one-click shopping"" service. critics say a similar model in europe would hurt small software developers which do not have the legal and financial might of larger companies. but supporters say current law does not let big companies protect inventions which they have spent years developing.","critics say the law would favour large companies over small ones and could impact open-source software innovation.in december, poland requested more time to consider the issue because it was concerned that the law could lead to the patenting of pure computer software.the eu says the law would bring europe more in line with how such laws work in the us, but this has caused some angry debate amongst critics and supporters.the draft law was not adopted by eu ministers as planned at a brussels meeting on monday during which it was supposed to have been discussed.the fresh delay came after polish officials had raised concerns about the law for the second time in two months.but supporters say current law does not let big companies protect inventions which they have spent years developing."
"tough rules for ringtone sellers  firms that flout rules on how ringtones and other mobile extras are sold could be cut off from all uk phone networks.  the rules allow offenders to be cut off if they do not let consumers know exactly what they get for their money and how to turn off the services. the first month under the new rules has seen at least ten firms suspended while they clean up the way they work. the rules have been brought in to ensure that the problems plaguing net users do not spread to mobile phones.  in the last couple of years ringtones, wallpapers, screensavers and lots of other extras for phones have become hugely popular. but fierce competition is making it difficult for firms to get their wares in front of consumers, said jeremy flynn, head of third party services at vodafone.  ""if you are not on the operator's portal you are going to have quite heavy marketing costs because it's a problem of how people discover your services,"" he said. to combat this many ringtone and other mobile content sellers started using a new tactic to squeeze more cash out of customers. this tactic involved signing people up for a subscription to give them, for instance, several ringtones per week or month instead of the single track they thought they were getting. mr flynn said that the move to using subscriptions happened over the space of a few weeks at the end of 2004. websites such as grumbletext.co.uk started getting reports from customers who were racking up large bills for phone content they did not know they had signed up for. ""what made us uncomfortable was that these services were not being marketed transparently,"" said mr flynn. ""people did not know they were being offered a subscription service."" ""we saw potential for substantial consumer harm here,"" he added.  the swift adoption of subscription services led to the creation of a new code of conduct for firms that want to sell content for mobile phones. the drafting of the new rules was led by the mobile entertainment forum and the uk's phone firms. ""everyone is required to conform to this code of conduct,"" said andrew bud, regulatory head of the mef and executive chairman of messaging firm mblox.  ""it's all about transparency,"" he said. ""consumers have to be told what they have got themselves into and how to get out of it."" ""the consumer has a right to be protected,"" he said. christian harris, partnership manager of mobile content firm zed, said the new system was essential if consumers were to trust companies that sell ringtones and other downloads. ""the groundrules must be applied across the whole industry and if that's done effectively we will see the cowboys driven out,"" he said. the new rules came in to force on 15 january and the first month under the new regime has seen many firms cautioned for not honouring them. some have been told to revamp websites so customers know what they get for their money and what they are signing up for, said mr flynn. also, said mr flynn, vodafone has briefly cut off between eight and ten content sellers flouting the rules. ""we have quite draconian contracts with firms,"" he said. ""we do not have to say why. we can just cut them off."" under the rules consumers must be able to switch off the services by using a universal ""stop"" command sent via text message. he said the system had been designed to limit how much a consumer will pay if they inadvertently signed up for a service.

"jones files conte lawsuit  marion jones has filed a lawsuit for defamation against balco boss victor conte following his allegations that he gave her performance-enhancing drugs.  the sydney olympic gold medallist says conte damaged her reputation and she is seeking $25m (£13m) in the suit. conte, whose company is at the centre of a doping investigation, made the claims in a us television programme. he and three others were indicted in february by a federal grand jury for a variety of alleged offences. in an email to the associated press on wednesday, conte said: ""i stand by everything i said"". jones won three gold medals and two bronzes in sydney in 2000. her lawsuit, filed in the us district court in san francisco, said the sprinter had passed a lie detector test and that she ""has never taken banned performance-enhancing drugs"". conte's statements, the suit added, were ""false and malicious"". after the abc television program earlier this month, jones' lawyer richard nicholls said: ""marion has steadfastly maintained her position throughout: she has never, ever used performance-enhancing drugs.

"brazil jobless rate hits new low  brazil's unemployment rate fell to its lowest level in three years in december, according to the government.  the brazilian institute for geography and statistics (ibge) said it fell to 9.6% in december from 10.6% in november and 10.9% in december 2003. ibge also said that average monthly salaries grew 1.9% in december 2004 from december 2003. however, average monthly wages fell 1.8% in december to 895.4 reais ($332; £179.3) from november. tuesday's figures represent the first time that the unemployment rate has fallen to a single digit since new measurement rules were introduced in 2001. the unemployment rate has been falling gradually since april 2004 when it reached a peak of 13.1%. the jobless rate average for the whole of 2004 was 11.5%, down from 12.3% in 2003, the ibge said.  this improvement can be attributed to the country's strong economic growth, with the economy registering growth of 5.2% in 2004, the government said. the economy is expected to grow by about 4% this year. president luiz inacio lula da silva promised to reduce unemployment when he was elected two years ago. nevertheless, some analysts say that unemployment could increase in the next months.

"german music in a 'zombie' state  the german music business - the third largest in the world - is ""in the state of a zombie"" because it has failed to respond to the challenge posed by downloading and piracy, a leading industry figure has said.  tim renner, the head of universal music germany until last year, told bbc world service's the music biz programme that the country's music industry was now struggling to survive. renner warned that unless the industry accepted ""new realties"" - such as downloading - its decline could become irreversible.

""we have a severe problem with piracy, especially internet piracy, and we also have a severe problem of private copying. ""i don't agree that the music industry lost control over the music market - in fact, especially in regard to germany talent, the market is quite successful."" he did, however, admit that copyright owners have ""partly lost control of their copyright"", due to piracy and copying.  but he refuted suggestions that the industry had been too slow to respond to digital downloading. ""we were the first to implement a download service - back in 1997,"" he argued. ""at that time it was not successful, because of the advent of piracy - it was the napster time, when p2p services became popular. ""it still is quite difficult for the music industry to compete with a price that is zero as far as the illegal product is concerned."" mr zombic also called for a change to the perception in germany that private copying of music is not a problem. german law does allow people to make copies of cds for their family and close friends, without fear of breaking copyright. mr zombic said that this legal framework was a ""huge problem"". ""there is a widespread attitude that private copying is a hobby, it's nice, it's fun,"" he added. ""we try to make clear it's not nice and it's not fun - it's endangering the creativity in our country.""","tim renner, the head of universal music germany until last year, told bbc world service's the music biz programme that the country's music industry was now struggling to survive.mr zombic also called for a change to the perception in germany that private copying of music is not a problem.""i don't agree that the music industry lost control over the music market - in fact, especially in regard to germany talent, the market is quite successful.""the music market in germany peaked in 1997, with sales of 2.6bn euros (£1.8bn).the german music business - the third largest in the world - is ""in the state of a zombie"" because it has failed to respond to the challenge posed by downloading and piracy, a leading industry figure has said.""the problem the music industry has got is that they aren't willing to accept that the classic way of doing business is over and out,"" he stated.however, peter zombic, the managing director of the international federation of phonographic industry in germany, said he did not feel the situation was as ""dramatic"" as mr renner believed.""so the music industry in its current form over here is pretty much in the state of a zombie.""""we have a severe problem with piracy, especially internet piracy, and we also have a severe problem of private copying.""at that time it was not successful, because of the advent of piracy - it was the napster time, when p2p services became popular."
"fannie mae 'should restate books'  us mortgage company fannie mae should restate its earnings, a move that is likely to put a billion-dollar dent in its accounts, watchdogs have said.  the securities & exchange commission accused fannie mae of using techniques that ""did not comply in material respects"" with accounting standards. fannie mae last month warned that some records were incorrect. the other main us mortgage firm freddie mac restated earnings by $5bn (£2.6bn) last year after a probe of its books. the sec's comments are likely to increase pressure on congress to strengthen supervision of fannie mae and freddie mac.  the two firms are key parts of the us financial system and effectively underwrite the mortgage market, financing nearly half of all american house purchases and dealing actively in bonds and other financial instruments. the investigation of freddie mac in june 2003 sparked concerns about the wider health of the industry and raised questionsmarks over the role of the office of federal housing enterprise oversight (ofheo), the industry's main regulator. having been pricked into action, the ofheo turned its attention to fannie may and in september this year said that the firm had tweaked its books to spread earnings more smoothly across quarters and play down the amount of risk it had taken on. the sec found similar problems. the watchdog's chief accountant donald nicolaisen said that ""fannie mae's methodology of assessing, measuring and documenting hedge ineffectiveness was inadequate and was not supported"" by generally accepted accounting principles.","us mortgage company fannie mae should restate its earnings, a move that is likely to put a billion-dollar dent in its accounts, watchdogs have said.the sec's comments are likely to increase pressure on congress to strengthen supervision of fannie mae and freddie mac.the other main us mortgage firm freddie mac restated earnings by $5bn (£2.6bn) last year after a probe of its books.fannie mae last month warned that some records were incorrect."
"labour's election love-in  peace and love have been in short supply in the labour party in recent days.  if press reports are to be believed, alan milburn and gordon brown have been at each other's throats over the contents of labour's next election manifesto. but the pair were all smiles on tuesday morning, as they joined john prescott to unveil labour's latest poster campaign. the event - at old billingsgate fish market on the banks of the thames - was a carefully choreographed show of unity. and the surest sign yet that we are heading for a general election in the next few months. it was also one of the most bizarre photo opportunities of recent years.  the first inkling something slightly odd was afoot was when - in place of the soft rock music normally chosen for such occasions - labour's speakers crackled to life with the sound of booker t and the mgs. then a vw camper van trundled into view, decked out in that most mind-bending of psychedelic messages - ""lowest mortgage rate for 40 years"". as the side-door slid open, it looked for one glorious moment as if the cabinet had decided to bury their differences and go on the road together, scooby doo-style. but, sadly, it wasn't the cabinet who had raided the dressing-up box - just six rather ill-at-ease looking labour students. two were dressed as regency dandies - to unveil a poster trumpeting ""the longest period of economic growth for 200 years"". another pair of students were in a beatle wig and sgt pepper jacket to highlight the ""lowest interest rates since the 1960s"".  the remaining two were dressed in a vague approximation of disco chic to demonstrate the ""lowest unemployment since the seventies"".  the politicians - led out by john prescott - were soberly-suited as always. the event may have been designed to highlight labour's economic success under mr brown, but there was little doubt who was in charge. the chancellor walked side-by-side with mr milburn, pointedly exchanging chit chat, as they approached the microphone. but it was mr milburn who took centre stage, speaking of the ""positive campaign"" the party hoped to stage in the ""coming weeks and months"".  the mobile poster vans would ""let people know britain is working again"". mr brown repeated the familiar mantras displayed on the posters and spoke of labour's ""shared purpose"" and ""united dedication"". it was left to mr prescott to pay glowing tribute to the chancellor's record and, in a final flourish, to produce his famous pledge card, from 1997, claiming labour has met all of its promises. the event was carefully stage-managed to underline cabinet unity. and, more specifically, to demonstrate the ""central role"" mr brown will play in the election campaign, despite being sidelined as campaign chief in favour of mr milburn.  but keen students of body language will have had a field day. there was much forced smiling for the cameras, but only mr prescott, who revels in such occasions, seemed to be truly enjoying himself. mr milburn made a point of turning to face the chancellor, as he spoke, nodding thoughtfully. but it was the former health secretary's final gesture, placing an arm on mr brown's back as they walked away from the microphones, which was perhaps the most telling. thanks for dropping by gordon, he might have been saying.","the event may have been designed to highlight labour's economic success under mr brown, but there was little doubt who was in charge.but it was mr milburn who took centre stage, speaking of the ""positive campaign"" the party hoped to stage in the ""coming weeks and months"".and, more specifically, to demonstrate the ""central role"" mr brown will play in the election campaign, despite being sidelined as campaign chief in favour of mr milburn.but it was the former health secretary's final gesture, placing an arm on mr brown's back as they walked away from the microphones, which was perhaps the most telling.there was much forced smiling for the cameras, but only mr prescott, who revels in such occasions, seemed to be truly enjoying himself.the event was carefully stage-managed to underline cabinet unity.it was left to mr prescott to pay glowing tribute to the chancellor's record and, in a final flourish, to produce his famous pledge card, from 1997, claiming labour has met all of its promises.it was also one of the most bizarre photo opportunities of recent years.mr brown repeated the familiar mantras displayed on the posters and spoke of labour's ""shared purpose"" and ""united dedication"".but the pair were all smiles on tuesday morning, as they joined john prescott to unveil labour's latest poster campaign.if press reports are to be believed, alan milburn and gordon brown have been at each other's throats over the contents of labour's next election manifesto."
"tories unveil quango blitz plans  plans to abolish 162 quangos have been unveiled by the conservatives as part of their effort to show how government red tape can be cut.  six government units would also be scrapped under proposals which the tories say would save more than £4.3bn. among the targets are strategic health authorities and the new fair access regulator for universities. tory frontbencher john redwood said britain needed a slimmer government and lower taxes to be competitive.  the plans would abolish regional assemblies and other regional bodies, such as boards tackling industrial development and housing. their powers would be returned to elected local councils or national government. the tories say the strategic health authorities are not needed as it is better that local people, rather than officials, run hospitals and surgeries.  announcing the plans, mr redwood said: ""mr blair has forgotten the interests of taxpayers, and has broken the pledges he made. ""far from improving public services, spending taxpayers' money on quangos has led only to more bureaucrats, more regulation and higher taxes."" his party leader, michael howard, argued a change in direction was needed to get a grip on spending. ""labour are creating two britains: the britain of the forgotten majority and bureaucratic britain,"" he said. ""in the real world, people are working harder just to stand still. they've seen their pensions knocked for six. ""they're being squeezed by extra taxes. the forgotten majority are paying the price of bureaucratic britain.""  the government has announced plans to cut 100,000 civil servants as part of its efficiency drive. but chief secretary to the treasury paul boateng attacked the tory plans. ""the conservatives are committed to cutting labour's public spending plans by a massive £35 billion,"" he said. ""cuts on this scale cannot be found from cutting 'bureaucracy' but would require massive cuts to front-line public services such as schools, hospitals and the police."" the liberal democrats have said they would cut the number of whitehall departments to make sure money reaches frontline services.","six government units would also be scrapped under proposals which the tories say would save more than £4.3bn.tory frontbencher john redwood said britain needed a slimmer government and lower taxes to be competitive.the government has announced plans to cut 100,000 civil servants as part of its efficiency drive.""the conservatives are committed to cutting labour's public spending plans by a massive £35 billion,"" he said.the tories say the strategic health authorities are not needed as it is better that local people, rather than officials, run hospitals and surgeries.plans to abolish 162 quangos have been unveiled by the conservatives as part of their effort to show how government red tape can be cut.the liberal democrats have said they would cut the number of whitehall departments to make sure money reaches frontline services.""labour are creating two britains: the britain of the forgotten majority and bureaucratic britain,"" he said."
"us trade gap ballooned in october  the us trade deficit widened by more than expected in october, hitting record levels after higher oil prices raised import costs, figures have shown  the trade shortfall was $55.5bn (£29bn), up 9% from september, the commerce department said. that pushed the 10 month deficit to $500.5bn. imports rose by 3.4%, while exports increased by only 0.6%. a weaker dollar also increased the cost of imports, though this should help drive export demand in coming months. ""things are getting worse, but that's to be expected,"" said david wyss of standard & poor's in new york. ""the first thing is that when the dollar goes down, it increases the price of imports. ""we are seeing improved export orders. things seem to be going in the right direction.""  despite this optimism, significant concerns remain as to how the us will fund its trade and budget deficits should they continue to widen. another problem highlighted by analysts was the growing trade gap with china, which has been accused of keeping its currency artificially weak in order to boost exports. the us imported almost $20bn worth of goods from china during october, exporting a little under $3bn. ""it seems the key worry that has existed in the currency market still remains,"" said anthony crescenzi, a bond strategist at miller tabak in new york. the trade deficit and the shortfall with china ""are big issues going forward"". the commerce department figures caused the dollar to weaken further despite widespread expectations that the federal reserve will raise interest rates for a fifth time this year. borrowing costs are tipped to rise by a quarter of a percentage point to 2.25% at a fed meeting later on tuesday.","the us trade deficit widened by more than expected in october, hitting record levels after higher oil prices raised import costs, figures have shown  the trade shortfall was $55.5bn (£29bn), up 9% from september, the commerce department said.a weaker dollar also increased the cost of imports, though this should help drive export demand in coming months.the trade deficit and the shortfall with china ""are big issues going forward"".imports rose by 3.4%, while exports increased by only 0.6%.that pushed the 10 month deficit to $500.5bn.the us imported almost $20bn worth of goods from china during october, exporting a little under $3bn."
"swap offer for pirated windows xp  computer giant microsoft has launched a pilot scheme to replace counterfeit versions of windows xp with legal ones.  the first-time initiative is restricted to the uk and to users with pre-installed copies of the operating system in pcs bought before november. until december microsoft said software can be sent to it for analysis if there are doubts about its legitimacy. the company aims to detect illegal traders and turn users of fake versions of windows into legitimate ones.  the windows xp counterfeit project will mean that software that is found to be counterfeit will be replaced for free, subject to certain conditions, until the end of the year. it is the first time microsoft has launched a counterfeit product replacement scheme in the world, the company told the bbc news website. in june, the software giant said that the major security update to windows xp, service pack 2, would not work with the most widely pirated versions of its operating system. the upgrade closed security loopholes in xp and added features that made it easier to keep machines safe from viruses and other types of malicious computer code.  the us company invited anyone who had suspicions about their version of windows xp to submit it for testing as soon as possible. the procedure consists of a series of computer checks, collating documents, and filling out a witness statement. ""this is a great opportunity for users to confirm the authenticity of windows xp software whilst helping gather vital information about illegal traders"", said alex hilton, licence compliance manager at microsoft. the scheme has also been welcomed by the technology and commerce industry. ""it is important that users ensure that they are legally licensed to avoid the risks of purchasing and using counterfeit products"", said david frost, director general of the british chambers of commerce. the plan would enable microsoft to gather intelligence about illegal traders in a prompt way, which would allow it to take action against software pirates. microsoft said it would evaluate the results of the uk programme before setting up similar schemes in other countries.","computer giant microsoft has launched a pilot scheme to replace counterfeit versions of windows xp with legal ones.in june, the software giant said that the major security update to windows xp, service pack 2, would not work with the most widely pirated versions of its operating system.""this is a great opportunity for users to confirm the authenticity of windows xp software whilst helping gather vital information about illegal traders"", said alex hilton, licence compliance manager at microsoft.microsoft said it would evaluate the results of the uk programme before setting up similar schemes in other countries.it is the first time microsoft has launched a counterfeit product replacement scheme in the world, the company told the bbc news website.the windows xp counterfeit project will mean that software that is found to be counterfeit will be replaced for free, subject to certain conditions, until the end of the year."

"india widens access to telecoms  india has raised the limit for foreign direct investment in telecoms companies from 49% to 74%.  communications minister dayanidhi maran said that there is a need to fund the fast-growing mobile market. the government hopes to increase the number of mobile users from 95 million to between 200 and 250 million by 2007.

""now everybody's doing reality shows. he's done it, he's been there, he's got to do something else,"" she said.  ozzy osbourne said he had had enough of the work involved in making the series.

"casual gaming to 'take off'  games aimed at ""casual players"" are set to be even bigger in 2005, according to industry experts.  easy-to-play titles that do not require too much time and that are playable online or downloadable to mobile devices will see real growth in the coming year. the trend shows that gaming is not just about big-hitting, games console titles, which appeal more to ""hardcore"" gamers, said a panel of experts. they were speaking before the annual consumer electronics show in las vegas which showcases the latest trends in gadgets and technologies for 2005. the panel also insisted that casual gamers were not just women, a common misconception which pervades current thinking about gamer demographics.  casual games like poker, pool, bridge, bingo and puzzle-based titles, which can be played online or downloaded onto mobile devices, were ""gender neutral"" and different genres attracted different players.  greg mills, program director at aol, said its figures suggested that sports-based games attracted 90% of 18 to 24-year-old males, while puzzle games were played by 80% of females. games like bridge tended to attract the over-50 demographic of gamers.  but hardcore gamers who are more attracted to blockbuster gamers which usually require hi-spec pcs, like half-life 2, or halo 2 on xbox, also liked to have a different type of gaming experience. ""when hardcore gamers are not playing halo, they are playing poker and pool, based on our research,"" said geoff graber, director of yahoo games, which attracts about 12 million gamers a month.  with the growth of powerful pc technology and ownership, broadband take-up, portable players and mobile devices, as well as interactive tv, casual gaming is shaping up to be big business in 2005, according to the panel. the focus for the coming year should be about attracting third-party developers into the field to offer more innovative and multiplayer titles, they agreed. ""we are at a time where we are on the verge of something much bigger,"" said mr graber. ""casual games will get into their stride in 2005, will be really big in 2006 and will be about community."" with more people finding more to do with their gadgets and high-speed connections, casual games would start to open up the world of gaming as a form of mass-market entertainment to more people. key to these types of titles is the chance they give people who may not see themselves as gamers to dip in and out of games when they liked.  portal sites which offer casual games, like aol, yahoo, and realarcade, as well as other games-on-demand services, allow people to build up buddy lists so they can return and play against the same people. this aspect of ""community"" is crucial for gamers who just want to have quick access to free or cheap games without committing long periods of time immersed in £30 to £40 console or pc titles, said the panel. about 120,000 people are expected to attend the ces trade show which stretches over more than 1.5 million square feet and which officially runs from 6 to 9 january. the main theme is how new devices are getting better at talking to each other, allowing people to enjoy digital content, like audio, video and images, when they want, and where they want.","the trend shows that gaming is not just about big-hitting, games console titles, which appeal more to ""hardcore"" gamers, said a panel of experts.this aspect of ""community"" is crucial for gamers who just want to have quick access to free or cheap games without committing long periods of time immersed in £30 to £40 console or pc titles, said the panel.key to these types of titles is the chance they give people who may not see themselves as gamers to dip in and out of games when they liked.casual games like poker, pool, bridge, bingo and puzzle-based titles, which can be played online or downloaded onto mobile devices, were ""gender neutral"" and different genres attracted different players.but hardcore gamers who are more attracted to blockbuster gamers which usually require hi-spec pcs, like half-life 2, or halo 2 on xbox, also liked to have a different type of gaming experience.with more people finding more to do with their gadgets and high-speed connections, casual games would start to open up the world of gaming as a form of mass-market entertainment to more people.""when hardcore gamers are not playing halo, they are playing poker and pool, based on our research,"" said geoff graber, director of yahoo games, which attracts about 12 million gamers a month.portal sites which offer casual games, like aol, yahoo, and realarcade, as well as other games-on-demand services, allow people to build up buddy lists so they can return and play against the same people."

"student 'inequality' exposed  teenagers from well-off backgrounds are six times more likely to go to university than those from the most deprived areas, a report says.  the higher education funding council for england said more people went to university between 1994 and 2000. but the percentage of poorer students ""hardly changed at all"", said its chief executive, sir howard newby. increasingly more women than men went to university, while tuition fees and student loans made no major difference.  the hefce report, drawing on child benefits data, said teenagers in the richest areas could expect a better than 50% chance of going to university, while in the poorest neighbourhoods it was 10%. participation at constituency level ranged from 69% in kensington and chelsea, 65% in the city of london and westminster and 62% in sheffield hallam, down to 10% in bristol south and leeds central and 8% in nottingham north and sheffield brightside.  sir howard said the report highlighted the ""entrenched divisions"" between rich and poor areas, but added it was a social as much as an educational problem. he told bbc news: ""we know, once children from deprived backgrounds get into university, they do very well. in fact surprisingly more go into postgraduate study than those from more affluent backgrounds. ""the issue is, i think, one of raising aspirations amongst those families and those communities that university is something for them and not for other people.""  he said by the time universities traditionally dealt with pupils, between the ages of 16 and 18, it was too late. instead they should be reaching out to communities and schools much earlier, even down to primary school level, to persuade them a university education was something they could aspire to, he said. but while the report revealed stark inequalities and exposed the extent of the challenge, there were some encouraging findings, he added.  tuition fees and student loans in england and wales - and the different fee regime in scotland - did not seem to have affected the choices of young people, even the poorest. the report also showed women were 18% more likely than men to enter higher education in 2000 - up from 6% in 1994. in the poorest areas, the gap was 30% in women's favour and growing faster than anywhere else. the higher education minister, kim howells, said: ""we are working in schools to raise the attainment and aspiration of young people in disadvantaged areas."" higher standards in schools would lead to greater participation in higher education. from 2006 upfront tuition fees in england would be removed, with grants for the less well off. the shadow education secretary, tim collins, said: ""it is clear from this report that children from disadvantaged areas are far more likely to have encountered poor standards in their secondary education. ""tackling these must be the top priority for any government looking to improve university access."" the group which represents university vice-chancellors, universities uk, said the new system of deferred fees in england, due to start in 2006, with grants and bursaries for poorer students, would encourage more of them to go into higher education. the national union of students argued the opposite - that the situation was ""likely to get much worse, with poorer students being restricted in choice and having to make decisions based on their financial situation rather than aspiration"".  the tables below show the participation rate for each parliamentary constituency in britain:","the higher education funding council for england said more people went to university between 1994 and 2000.the group which represents university vice-chancellors, universities uk, said the new system of deferred fees in england, due to start in 2006, with grants and bursaries for poorer students, would encourage more of them to go into higher education.instead they should be reaching out to communities and schools much earlier, even down to primary school level, to persuade them a university education was something they could aspire to, he said.the higher education minister, kim howells, said: ""we are working in schools to raise the attainment and aspiration of young people in disadvantaged areas.""teenagers from well-off backgrounds are six times more likely to go to university than those from the most deprived areas, a report says.the hefce report, drawing on child benefits data, said teenagers in the richest areas could expect a better than 50% chance of going to university, while in the poorest neighbourhoods it was 10%.the shadow education secretary, tim collins, said: ""it is clear from this report that children from disadvantaged areas are far more likely to have encountered poor standards in their secondary education.higher standards in schools would lead to greater participation in higher education.he said by the time universities traditionally dealt with pupils, between the ages of 16 and 18, it was too late.the report also showed women were 18% more likely than men to enter higher education in 2000 - up from 6% in 1994."
"sporting rivals go to extra time  the current slew of sports games offers unparalleled opportunities for fans who like to emulate on-field action without ever moving from the couch.  the two giants in the field - espn and ea sports - have been locked in a heavyweight battle for years. the latter is the world's largest games manufacturer. years of experience mean that the titles in their steady flow of sport sims are finely honed, massively entertaining and ooze flair. sports broadcaster espn, meanwhile, has leant its name to a series of games that are similarly classy but lower in profile and price. but that status quo was changed forever - or for the next 15 years at least - by a deal earlier this year when espn sold ea the rights to its tv branding and on-air talent, meaning the espn games presently developed by sega will have to come to and end in their present form.  it was a massive-money deal that not only raised eyebrows but stirred active indignation in many quarters, with fans concerned that it is set to enable ea to monopolise the sports gaming landscape to an unhealthy degree. some particularly disgruntled fans set up an online petition that notched more than 18,000 virtual signatures. many of those clicking to complain were already rankled, for the espn coup happened just weeks after ea had pulled off another enormous licensing deal, controversially giving them exclusive rights to teams and personnel from america&#191;s national football league (nfl). so, will the sega - espn range be missed? a key reason for answering ""yes"" is that liking or disliking a sports game regularly comes down to personal taste, and having some options available always proves hugely handy. online soccer fans will testify to that, between bouts of arguing over which high-profile title rules supreme out of the similar-yet-hugely-different fifa 2005 and pro evolution soccer 4. on the same note, the espn 2k5 and ea sports games have so little to choose between them that picking favourites will come down to players' personal preferences and spending budget rather than any technical elements. taking hockey and basketball as examples, both publishers' efforts are phenomenally entertaining and fairly accessible. they also both look awesome, with the sega / espn versions perhaps shading things on a graphical front.  in terms of gameplay, i marginally preferred ea's nba live 2005 for basketball, and was more satisfied ice hockey-wise by espn's nhl 2k5. the espn games are a touch more arcade-like in look and feel and are slightly easier to get into, although like their rivals, they also offer a dizzyingly-extensive array of in-game tricks and overall challenge modes that should be enough to quench thirsts of even the most die-hard of sports fans. perhaps the most interesting aspect of the espn deal will be seeing how it affects the presentation of ea's future titles. the front-end decoration of ea's games has become something of an art-form in itself, loaded with slick visuals and oodles of licensed music. they are also immediately identifiable as coming from the ea stable, and the inevitable compulsion to add an espn look will no doubt change that in various ways. what is a shame is that the espn titles took similar care about framing the gameplay with an authentic setting - their preambles look and sound much like they would on tv. they are neat and excellent-value games in their current form, and combining them with ea's own established brand should produce a truly formidable beast.","but that status quo was changed forever - or for the next 15 years at least - by a deal earlier this year when espn sold ea the rights to its tv branding and on-air talent, meaning the espn games presently developed by sega will have to come to and end in their present form.on the same note, the espn 2k5 and ea sports games have so little to choose between them that picking favourites will come down to players' personal preferences and spending budget rather than any technical elements.the espn games are a touch more arcade-like in look and feel and are slightly easier to get into, although like their rivals, they also offer a dizzyingly-extensive array of in-game tricks and overall challenge modes that should be enough to quench thirsts of even the most die-hard of sports fans.sports broadcaster espn, meanwhile, has leant its name to a series of games that are similarly classy but lower in profile and price.so, will the sega - espn range be missed?they also both look awesome, with the sega / espn versions perhaps shading things on a graphical front.the current slew of sports games offers unparalleled opportunities for fans who like to emulate on-field action without ever moving from the couch.the two giants in the field - espn and ea sports - have been locked in a heavyweight battle for years.perhaps the most interesting aspect of the espn deal will be seeing how it affects the presentation of ea's future titles."

"brown's poll campaign move denied  the government has denied reports that gordon brown is preparing to oust alan milburn as labour's election supremo.  work and pensions minister alan johnson said it was wrong to suggest the chancellor would usurp mr milburn, adding they would ""work as a team"". a report in the sunday business claimed mr brown has been asked to take charge of media strategy, while mr milburn would move to a behind-the-scenes role. labour has always maintained mr brown would have a central campaign role.  but many labour backbenchers are said to be dissatisfied with the way election campaigning has gone and have said they wanted to see the chancellor take a bigger role. some commentators say the tories have grasped the initiative, putting labour on the back foot, having to respond to conservative policy announcements. these claims follow various opinion polls which suggest the tories have been gaining on labour. party strategists are believed to want to bring mr brown to centre-stage having seen support rise, in private polling, after his budget last week. but another report in the sunday telegraph claims mr milburn is unwilling to allow any new role for the chancellor to come at his expense. mr johnson told bbc news: ""gordon brown will play a central role in any election campaign. ""they were wrong when they said milburn was ousting brown and they're wrong now if they are saying brown is ousting milburn. we work as a team."" mr milburn has repeatedly said the chancellor was key to the campaign and dismissed claims of a rift. neither downing street nor the labour party would comment directly on the reports.","labour has always maintained mr brown would have a central campaign role.work and pensions minister alan johnson said it was wrong to suggest the chancellor would usurp mr milburn, adding they would ""work as a team"".a report in the sunday business claimed mr brown has been asked to take charge of media strategy, while mr milburn would move to a behind-the-scenes role.mr milburn has repeatedly said the chancellor was key to the campaign and dismissed claims of a rift.mr johnson told bbc news: ""gordon brown will play a central role in any election campaign.but another report in the sunday telegraph claims mr milburn is unwilling to allow any new role for the chancellor to come at his expense."
"brown ally rejects budget spree  chancellor gordon brown's closest ally has denied suggestions there will be a budget giveaway on 16 march.  ed balls, ex-chief economic adviser to the treasury, said there would be no spending spree before polling day. but mr balls, a prospective labour mp, said he was confident the chancellor would meet his fiscal rules. he was speaking as sir digby jones, cbi director general, warned mr brown not to be tempted to use any extra cash on pre-election bribes.  mr balls, who stepped down from his treasury post to stand as a labour candidate in the election, had suggested that mr brown would meet his golden economic rule - ""with a margin to spare"". he said he hoped more would be done to build on current tax credit rules.  he also stressed rise in interest rates ahead of an expected may election would not affect the labour party's chances of winning. expectations of a rate rise have gathered pace after figures showed house prices are still rising. consumer borrowing rose at a near-record pace in january. ""if the mpc (the bank of england's monetary policy committee) were to judge that a rate rise was justified before the election because of the strength of the economy - and i'm not predicting that they will - i do not believe that this will be a big election issue in britain for labour,"" he told a parliamentary lunch. ""this is a big change in our political culture.""  during an interview with bbc radio 4's today programme, mr balls said he was sure mr brown's budget would not put at risk the stability of the economy. ""i don't think we'll see a pre-election spending spree - we certainly did not see that before 2001,"" he said.  his assurances came after sir digby jones said stability was all important and any extra cash should be spent on improving workers' skills. his message to the chancellor was: ""please don't give it away in any form of electioneering."" sir digby added: ""i don't think he will. i have to say he has been a prudent chancellor right the way through. stability is the key word - british business needs boring stability more than anything.

"bt boosts its broadband packages  british telecom has said it will double the broadband speeds of most of its home and business customers.  the increased speeds will come at no extra charge and follows a similar move by internet service provider aol. many bt customers will now have download speeds of 2mbps, although there are usage allowances of between one gigabyte and 30 gigabytes a month. the new speeds start to come into effect on 17 february for home customers and 1 april for businesses. ""britain is now broadband britain,"" said duncan ingram, bt's managing director, broadband and internet services. he added: ""ninety percent of our customers will see real increases in speed.  ""these speed increases will give people the opportunity to do a lot more with their broadband connections,"" he said. upload speeds - the speed at which information is sent from a pc via broadband - will remain at the same speed, said mr ingram. despite the increases, bt will continue to have usage allowances for home customers. ""the allowances are extremely generous,"" said mr ingram ""for what we are seeing in the market place - they are really not an issue."" bt will begin enforcing the allowances in the summer. customers who exceed the amounts will either be able to pay for a bigger allowance or see their download speeds reduced. bt now has a 36% share of the broadband market - down from 39% - which is becoming increasingly competitive. in the last few months, many rival isps have begun to offer 2mbps services, including aol, plusnet and uk online.  but britain continues to lag behind some countries - especially japan and south korea - which offer broadband speeds of up to 40mbps. but mr ingram said it was important to ""separate hype from reality"". he said that a limited number of people with those connections consistently received speeds of 40mbps. customers will not see their connections double immediately on 17 february. mr ingram said there would be a roll out across the network in order to prevent any problems.","upload speeds - the speed at which information is sent from a pc via broadband - will remain at the same speed, said mr ingram.british telecom has said it will double the broadband speeds of most of its home and business customers.""these speed increases will give people the opportunity to do a lot more with their broadband connections,"" he said.he said that a limited number of people with those connections consistently received speeds of 40mbps.many bt customers will now have download speeds of 2mbps, although there are usage allowances of between one gigabyte and 30 gigabytes a month.customers who exceed the amounts will either be able to pay for a bigger allowance or see their download speeds reduced.""britain is now broadband britain,"" said duncan ingram, bt's managing director, broadband and internet services.but britain continues to lag behind some countries - especially japan and south korea - which offer broadband speeds of up to 40mbps."
"bush website blocked outside us  surfers outside the us have been unable to visit the official re-election site of president george w bush.  the blocking of browsers sited outside the us began in the early hours of monday morning. since then people outside the us trying to browse the site get a message saying they are not authorised to view it. the blocking does not appear to be due to an attack by vandals or malicious hackers, but as a result of a policy decision by the bush camp.  the international exclusion zone around georgewbush.com was spotted by net monitoring firm netcraft which keeps an eye on traffic patterns across many different sites. netcraft said that since the early hours of 25 october attempts to view the site through its monitoring stations in london, amsterdam and sydney failed.  by contrast netcraft's four monitoring stations in the us managed to view the site with no problems. the site can still be seen using anonymous proxy services that are based in the us. some web users in canada also report that they can browse the site. the pattern of traffic to the website suggests that the blocking was not due to an attack by vandals or politically motivated hackers. geographic blocking works because the numerical addresses that the net uses to organise itself are handed out on a regional basis. on 21 october, the george w bush website began using the services of a company called akamai to ensure that the pages, videos and other content on its site reaches visitors. mike prettejohn, president of netcraft, speculated that the blocking decision might have been taken to cut costs, and traffic, in the run-up to the election on 2 november. he said the site may see no reason to distribute content to people who will not be voting next week. managing traffic could also be a good way to ensure that the site stays working in the closing days of the election campaign. however, simply blocking non-us visitors also means that americans overseas are barred too. akamai declined to comment, saying it could not talk about customer websites.","since then people outside the us trying to browse the site get a message saying they are not authorised to view it.surfers outside the us have been unable to visit the official re-election site of president george w bush.by contrast netcraft's four monitoring stations in the us managed to view the site with no problems.netcraft said that since the early hours of 25 october attempts to view the site through its monitoring stations in london, amsterdam and sydney failed.on 21 october, the george w bush website began using the services of a company called akamai to ensure that the pages, videos and other content on its site reaches visitors.the site can still be seen using anonymous proxy services that are based in the us.the blocking of browsers sited outside the us began in the early hours of monday morning."

"progress on new internet domains  by early 2005 the net could have two new domain names.  the .post and .travel net domains have been given preliminary approval by the net's administrative body. the names are just two of a total of 10 proposed domains that are being considered by the internet corporation for assigned names and numbers, icann. the other proposed names include a domain for pornography, asia, mobile phones, an anti-spam domain and one for the catalan language and culture.  the .post domain is backed by the universal postal union that wants to use it as the online marker for every type of postal service and to help co-ordinate the e-commerce efforts of national post offices.  the .travel domain would be used by hotels, travel firms, airlines, tourism offices and would help such organisations distinguish themselves online. it is backed by a new york-based trade group called the travel partnership. icann said its early decision on the two domains was in response to the detailed technical and commercial information the organisations behind the names had submitted. despite this initial approval, icann cautioned that there was no guarantee that the domains would actually go into service. at the same time icann is considering proposals for another eight domains. one that may not win approval is a proposal to set up a .xxx domain for pornographic websites. a similar proposal has been made many times in the past. but icann has been reluctant to approve it because of the difficulty of making pornographers sign up and use it. in 2000 icann approved seven other new domains that have had varying degrees of success. three of the new so-called top level domains were for specific industries or organisations such as .museum and .aero. others such as .info and .biz were intended to be more generic. in total there are in excess of 200 domain names and the majority of these are for nations. but domains that end in the .com suffix are by far the most numerous.","by early 2005 the net could have two new domain names.the names are just two of a total of 10 proposed domains that are being considered by the internet corporation for assigned names and numbers, icann.in 2000 icann approved seven other new domains that have had varying degrees of success.the other proposed names include a domain for pornography, asia, mobile phones, an anti-spam domain and one for the catalan language and culture.icann said its early decision on the two domains was in response to the detailed technical and commercial information the organisations behind the names had submitted.despite this initial approval, icann cautioned that there was no guarantee that the domains would actually go into service.in total there are in excess of 200 domain names and the majority of these are for nations.the .post and .travel net domains have been given preliminary approval by the net's administrative body."
"karachi stocks hit historic high  the karachi stock exchange (kse) has recorded its largest single day gain, surging 3.5% to a new high.  the index rose 225.79 points in four hours of furious trading, with many investors optimistic that political stability could bring an economic boom. the kse index closed at 6709.93 - an overall gain of nearly 400 points in the first two trading days of the week. energy and telecommunication stocks performed particularly well, recording an 8%-10% rise since monday morning.  in 2002, the kse was the world's best performing stock market, with the index rising 112%.  pakistani investors are expecting the kse to repeat, if not improve on, its 2002 performance. jubilant investors danced on the streets as the market closed for the day on tuesday, confident that the boom will continue at least until the public holiday on 22 january. others, however, who had stayed out fearing an imminent collapse because of prices overheating, continued to warn that the ""bubble may burst any time"". ""that's rubbish,"" kse chairman yaseen lakhani told the bbc news website. ""whenever the market reflects pakistan's true economic reality, it is described as a bubble."" mr lakhani feels that the market has risen on the basis of solid economic growth and its current level rests on sound foundations.  market analysts are inclined to agree with mr lakhani, arguing that there are a number of major factors behind the kse's performance. analysts argue that a steady improvement in pakistan's credit ratings by international credit rating agencies has finally begun to register in the market. standard & poor's upgraded pakistan a few weeks ago. there are indications of yet another upgrade by the end of february.  then, say analysts, there is corporate profitability in the current fiscal year, which has gone up by 27% from last year. ""coupled with the 7% gdp growth expected by june this year, i am least surprised at the market's performance,"" says mr lakhani. one leading karachi broker said the real reasons may be political. ""if you file a $1.3 trillion case against saudi money after 9/11, arab money will not go to the us any more."" a lot of arab money, he says, has already gone to malaysia and indonesia. pakistanis are now hoping that energy and telecoms, two of the strongest sectors in pakistan, draw some of the arab money to the kse.  locally, too, say analysts, recent political developments have worked to the market's advantage.  an anti-musharraf campaign threatened by the mma, a countrywide alliance of religious parties, has fizzled out. the release of asif zardari, former prime minister benazir bhutto's husband, has eased political tensions between the military-backed government and the opposition pakistan people's party. most importantly, say analysts, the failure of talks between india and pakistan on the baglihar dam in indian-administered kashmir has not automatically led to heightened tensions. this, they say, indicates that neither country is interested in raising the temperature at this stage, irrespective of the state of their disagreements. the market is abuzz with speculation that substantial investment may now start to flow in from the us, a country seen locally as deeply interested in defusing tensions between the south asian neighbours.

"open source leaders slam patents  the war of words between microsoft and the open source movement heated up this week as linux founder linus torvalds led an attack on software patents.  in a panel discussion at a linux summit in california mr torvalds said software patents were a problem for the open source movement. mitchell kapor, chairman of the mozilla foundation, warned that microsoft could use patent lawsuits in the future. linux is a freely-available alternative to microsoft's windows. it relies on a community of programmers for its development and is based on open source principles, which allow others to use and modify it without having to pay licence fees. the attack on software patents comes at a time when ibm has made 500 of its patents freely available. other companies are expected to follow suit.  there are between 150,000 and 300,000 registered software patents in the us and open source developers argue that many should never have been granted. this is a view corroborated by the uk patent office. ""some of the patents have dubious validity and are being wielded by some big companies to force smaller companies to buy licenses in the knowledge that they can't afford to take them to court,"" said dr jeremy philpott of the uk patent office. some panel members are worried that microsoft would issue a series of patent lawsuits in the future. ""if totally pushed to the wall - because their business model no longer holds up in an era in which open source is an economically superior way to produce software...of course they're going to unleash the wmds,"" mr kapor is reported as saying. microsoft did not want to comment directly, referring the issue instead to trade body intellect, of which it is a member. ""as far as intellect is concerned, open source and patents have co-existed for many years without problems,"" said spokeswoman jill sutherland. ""the industry respects the open source movement and in fact many of the members we represent use the open source system to develop software,"" ""we think the important point to make is that companies should be able to choose between patents, copyrights and open source as to the treatment of their intellectual discoveries, and not be forced into using one or the other,"" she added.","in a panel discussion at a linux summit in california mr torvalds said software patents were a problem for the open source movement.there are between 150,000 and 300,000 registered software patents in the us and open source developers argue that many should never have been granted.""the industry respects the open source movement and in fact many of the members we represent use the open source system to develop software,"" ""we think the important point to make is that companies should be able to choose between patents, copyrights and open source as to the treatment of their intellectual discoveries, and not be forced into using one or the other,"" she added.""as far as intellect is concerned, open source and patents have co-existed for many years without problems,"" said spokeswoman jill sutherland.the war of words between microsoft and the open source movement heated up this week as linux founder linus torvalds led an attack on software patents.some panel members are worried that microsoft would issue a series of patent lawsuits in the future."

"pandas benefit from wireless net  the world's dwindling panda population is getting a helping hand from a wireless internet network.  the wolong nature reserve in the sichuan province of southwest china is home to 20% of the remaining 1,500 giant pandas in the world. a broadband and wireless network installed on the reserve has allowed staff to chronicle the pandas' daily activities. the data and images can be shared with colleagues around the world. the reserve conducts vital research on both panda breeding and bamboo ecology.  using the network, vets have been able to observe how infant pandas feed and suggest changes to improve the tiny cubs' chances of survival.  ""digital technology has transformed the way we communicate and share information inside wolong and with the rest of the world,"" said zhang hemin, director of the wolong nature reserve.

"boeing unveils new 777 aircraft  us aircraft firm boeing has unveiled its new long-distance 777 plane, as it tries to regain its position as the industry's leading manufacturer.  the 777-200lr will be capable of flying almost 11,000 miles non-stop, linking cities such as london and sydney. boeing, in contrast to european rival airbus, hopes airlines will want to fly smaller aircraft over longer distances. airbus, which overtook boeing as the number one civilian planemaker in 2003, is focusing on so-called super jumbos.  analysts are divided over which approach is best and say that this latest tussle between boeing and airbus may prove to be a defining moment for the airline industry. boeing plans to offer twin-engine planes that are able to fly direct to many of the world's airports, getting rid of the need for connecting flights.  it is banking on smaller, slimmer planes such as the 777-200lr and its much-anticipated 787 dreamliner plane, which is set to take to the skies in 2008. the 777-200lr, which had its launch delayed by the 11 september attacks in the us, is the fifth variation of boeing's twin-aisle 777 plane. the company offically ""rolled-out"" the new 777 in seattle at 2200 gmt. better fuel efficiency from engines made by ge and lighter materials mean that the plane can connect almost any two cities worldwide.  ""boeing has the latest variant in a very successful line of airplanes and there is no doubt it will continue to be very successful,"" said david learmount, operations and safety editor at industry magazine flight international. but the 777-200lr ""is a niche player"", mr learmount continued, adding that reach was not the only criteria airlines used when picking their aircraft. mr learmount pointed out that the 777-200lr has been on the market for a couple of years and only had limited success at attracting orders. he also said that while the plane may be able to fly to sydney from london in one hit, prevailing winds meant that it would have to stop somewhere on the return journey.  for airbus, the future is big - it is pinning its hopes on planes that can carry as many as 840 people between large hub airports. from there, passengers would be ferried to their final destinations by smaller planes. airbus is also keeping its options open and plans to compete in all the main categories of aircraft. it has been producing a rival to boeing's 777 line for more than a year. ""airbus is now where boeing was a few years ago"" with its product range, said flight international's mr learmount.  both boeing and airbus have been taking orders for their new planes. boeing said it expected to sell about 500 of its 777-200lr planes over the next 20 years. it already has orders from pakistan international airlines and eva of taiwan. these orders should help underpin the company's profits. boeing said earnings during the last three months of 2004 dropped by 84% because of costs relating to stopping production of its smallest airliner, the 717, and the cancellation of a us air force 767 tanker contract. net profit was $186m (£98m; 143m euros) in the quarter, compared with $1.13bn in the same period in 2003.","both boeing and airbus have been taking orders for their new planes.boeing said it expected to sell about 500 of its 777-200lr planes over the next 20 years.""airbus is now where boeing was a few years ago"" with its product range, said flight international's mr learmount.us aircraft firm boeing has unveiled its new long-distance 777 plane, as it tries to regain its position as the industry's leading manufacturer.boeing, in contrast to european rival airbus, hopes airlines will want to fly smaller aircraft over longer distances.it is banking on smaller, slimmer planes such as the 777-200lr and its much-anticipated 787 dreamliner plane, which is set to take to the skies in 2008.""boeing has the latest variant in a very successful line of airplanes and there is no doubt it will continue to be very successful,"" said david learmount, operations and safety editor at industry magazine flight international.boeing plans to offer twin-engine planes that are able to fly direct to many of the world's airports, getting rid of the need for connecting flights.he also said that while the plane may be able to fly to sydney from london in one hit, prevailing winds meant that it would have to stop somewhere on the return journey.analysts are divided over which approach is best and say that this latest tussle between boeing and airbus may prove to be a defining moment for the airline industry."
"camera phones are 'must-haves'  four times more mobiles with cameras in them will be sold in europe by the end of 2004 than last year, says a report from analysts gartner.  globally, the number sold will reach 159 million, an increase of 104%. the report predicts that nearly 70% of all mobile phones sold will have a built-in camera by 2008. improving imaging technology in mobiles is making them an increasingly ""must-have"" buy. in europe, cameras on mobiles can take 1.3 megapixel images. but in japan and asia pacific, where camera phone technology is much more advanced, mobiles have already been released which can take 3.2 megapixel images. japan still dominates mobile phone technology, and the uptake there is huge. by 2008, according to gartner, 95% of all mobiles sold there will have cameras on them.  camera phones had some teething problems when they were first launched as people struggled with poor quality images and uses for them, as well as the complexity and expense of sending them via mms (multimedia messaging services). this has changed in the last 18 months. handset makers have concentrated on trying to make phones easier to use. realising that people like to use their camera phones in different ways, they have introduced more design features, like rotating screens and viewfinders, removable memory cards and easier controls to send picture messages.  mobile companies have introduced more ways for people to share photos with other people. these have included giving people easier ways to publish them on websites, or mobile blogs - moblogs. but the report suggests that until image quality increases more, people will not be interested in printing out pictures at kiosks. image sensor technology inside cameras phones is improving. the gartner report suggests that by mid-2005, it is likely that the image resolution of most camera phones will be more than two megapixels. consumer digital cameras images range from two to four megapixels in quality, and up to six megapixels on a high-end camera. but a lot of work is being done to make camera phones more like digital cameras. some handsets already feature limited zoom capability, and manufacturers are looking into technological improvements that will let people take more photos in poorly-lit conditions, like nightclubs. other developments include wide-angle modes, basic editing features, and better sensors and processors for recording film clips.  images from camera phones have even made it into the art world. an exhibition next month in aid of the charity mencap, will feature snaps taken from the camera phones of top artists.  the exhibition, fonetography, will feature images taken by photographers david bailey, rankin and nan goldin, and artists sir peter blake, tracey emin and jack vettriano. but some uses for them have worried many organisations. intel, samsung, the uk's foreign office and lawrence livermore national laboratories in the us, have decided to ban camera phones from their buildings for fear of sensitive information being snapped and leaked. many schools, fitness centres and local councils have also banned them over fears about privacy and misuse. italy's information commissioner has also voiced concern and has issued guidelines on where and how the phones can be used. but camera phone fears have not dampened the manufacturers' profits. according to recent figures, sony ericsson's profits tripled in the third-quarter because of new camera phones. over 60% of mobiles sold during the three months through to september featured integrated cameras, it said.","the report predicts that nearly 70% of all mobile phones sold will have a built-in camera by 2008.image sensor technology inside cameras phones is improving.by 2008, according to gartner, 95% of all mobiles sold there will have cameras on them.but in japan and asia pacific, where camera phone technology is much more advanced, mobiles have already been released which can take 3.2 megapixel images.the gartner report suggests that by mid-2005, it is likely that the image resolution of most camera phones will be more than two megapixels.but camera phone fears have not dampened the manufacturers' profits.in europe, cameras on mobiles can take 1.3 megapixel images.four times more mobiles with cameras in them will be sold in europe by the end of 2004 than last year, says a report from analysts gartner.images from camera phones have even made it into the art world.but a lot of work is being done to make camera phones more like digital cameras.camera phones had some teething problems when they were first launched as people struggled with poor quality images and uses for them, as well as the complexity and expense of sending them via mms (multimedia messaging services).consumer digital cameras images range from two to four megapixels in quality, and up to six megapixels on a high-end camera.realising that people like to use their camera phones in different ways, they have introduced more design features, like rotating screens and viewfinders, removable memory cards and easier controls to send picture messages."
"will tory tax cuts lift spirits?  michael howard has finally revealed the full scale of his planned tory tax cuts.  should he win the next general election, he has earmarked £4 billion that will be used to reduce taxes - although he still will not say which or how. this was the pre-election message many in his party have been pressing for and voters, he believes, will warm to. at its simplest, it is saying: ""vote tory and you can have it both ways"". not only would his government stick to labour spending plans on core public services, including health and education, it would increase spending on defence, police and pensions. and even after that was done, it would still have enough left over for a tax cut equivalent to about a penny off the basic rate of income tax.  all the money would come from its £35 billion efficiency savings which would see the axe taken to bureaucracy, waste and the civil service. of that, £23 billion would go on spending plans, with £8 billion to fill the black hole left, they claim, by gordon brown, and the rest going in tax cuts.  neither mr howard nor mr letwin would say exactly how they would use that cash, although a cut in the basic rate seems unlikely. ideas already floated include raising tax thresholds and abolishing or reducing inheritance tax, although some in the tory party are urging mr howard to announce something more eye-catching before the election. as the tory leader declared, the aim of the exercise is to open up a real economic policy divide between labour and the tories. ""at this election, people will have a clear choice between mr blair who will waste more and tax more and the conservative party which will give value for money and tax less,"" he said.  it is a move back towards an almost traditional tory message which previously suggested labour was the party of tax rises and the conservatives the party of tax cuts.  the extension of that, however, was that labour was also seen as the party of big spending on the public services while the tories were the cutters. and that is where one of the problems lies for mr howard - can he persuade sceptical voters that they really can have it both ways with bigger spending on public services and lower taxes? he insists he will not promise anything before the election that he cannot deliver if put into downing street. labour, needless to say, claim his planned £35bn efficiency savings simply don't add up and that those sorts of figures are fantasy.  one of new labour's greatest successes before the historic 1997 election was to persuade voters, business and the city that it could be trusted to run the economy. so far that has not faced any real challenge, but independent analysts now claim a third new labour government would be forced to either increase taxation or taxes to plug a black hole it has at the centre of its finances. meanwhile, the liberal democrats are committed to increasing taxes for the most well off to finance their spending proposals launched earlier in the day. so, mr howard hopes his message will start to hit home during this unofficial election campaign and that his poll ratings might finally lift off the floor. and, while other issues like the iraq war and trust will play a major part in that campaign, it is likely - and the prime minister probably hopes - that the economy will be the deciding factor.","it is a move back towards an almost traditional tory message which previously suggested labour was the party of tax rises and the conservatives the party of tax cuts.ideas already floated include raising tax thresholds and abolishing or reducing inheritance tax, although some in the tory party are urging mr howard to announce something more eye-catching before the election.and even after that was done, it would still have enough left over for a tax cut equivalent to about a penny off the basic rate of income tax.""at this election, people will have a clear choice between mr blair who will waste more and tax more and the conservative party which will give value for money and tax less,"" he said.michael howard has finally revealed the full scale of his planned tory tax cuts.of that, £23 billion would go on spending plans, with £8 billion to fill the black hole left, they claim, by gordon brown, and the rest going in tax cuts.should he win the next general election, he has earmarked £4 billion that will be used to reduce taxes - although he still will not say which or how.the extension of that, however, was that labour was also seen as the party of big spending on the public services while the tories were the cutters.so far that has not faced any real challenge, but independent analysts now claim a third new labour government would be forced to either increase taxation or taxes to plug a black hole it has at the centre of its finances."

""50's beef is 50's beef and i really don't know where all this stems from."" when 50 cent appeared on the same station two days later, he said the game was no longer a member of g-unit.

"rich grab half colombia poor fund  half of the money put aside by the colombian government to help the country's poor is benefiting people who do not need it, a study has found.  a total of 24.2 trillion pesos ($10.2bn; £5.5bn) is earmarked for subsidies for the poor, the government department for planning said. but it also found 12.1 trillion pesos was going to the richest part of the population, rather than to those in need. sound distribution of the cash could cut poverty levels to 36% from 53%, the government believes. ""resources are more than enough to reduce poverty and there is no need for more tax reforms but a better distribution,"" deputy planning director jose leibovich said.  colombia has a population of about 44 million and half lives below poverty line. however, some large properties are paying less in tax as they are situated inside poor areas, which benefit from cheaper utilities such as electricity and water, government research found. government expenditure in areas such as pensions, public services, education, property and health should be revised, mr leibovich said. he added that the government is now examining the report, but warned there would be no easy solution to the problem. with a good distribution of such subsidies and economic growth of just 2%, by 2019 poverty could fall as low as 15.3%, he said.","a total of 24.2 trillion pesos ($10.2bn; £5.5bn) is earmarked for subsidies for the poor, the government department for planning said.sound distribution of the cash could cut poverty levels to 36% from 53%, the government believes.half of the money put aside by the colombian government to help the country's poor is benefiting people who do not need it, a study has found.""resources are more than enough to reduce poverty and there is no need for more tax reforms but a better distribution,"" deputy planning director jose leibovich said."

"india seeks to boost construction  india has cleared a proposal allowing up to 100% foreign direct investment in its construction sector.  kamal nath, commerce and industry minister, announced the decision in delhi on thursday following a cabinet meeting. analysts say improving india's infrastructure will boost foreign investment in other sectors too. the indian government's decision has spread good cheer in the construction sector, according to some indian firms.  a spokesman for dlf builders, dr vancheshwar, told the bbc this will mean ""better offerings"" for consumers as well as builders. he said the firm will benefit from world class ""strategic partnerships, design expertise and technology, while consumers will have better choice.""  the government proposal states that foreign investment of up to 100% will be allowed on the 'automatic route' in the construction sector, on projects including housing, hotels, resorts, hospitals and educational establishments. the automatic route means that construction companies need only get one set of official approvals and do not need to gain clearance from the foreign investment promotion board, which can be bureaucratic. the government hopes its new policy will create employment for construction workers, and benefit steel and brick-making industries.  mr nath also announced plans to allow foreign investors to develop a smaller area of any land they acquired. ""foreign investors can enter any construction development area, be it to build resorts, townships or commercial premises but they will have to construct at least 50,000 square meters (538,000 square feet) within a specific timeframe,"" said mr nath, without specifying the timeframe. previously foreign investors had to develop a much larger area, discouraging some from entering the indian market. this measure is designed to discourage foreign investors from buying and selling land speculatively, without developing it. anshuman magazine, managing director, of cb richard ellis - an international real estate company - told the bbc this was ""a big positive step.""  however, chittabrata majumdar, general secretary of the centre of indian trade unions (citu), said allowing fdi in the country is compromising india's own ""self reliance"". he said, ""no country can develop on the basis of foreign investment alone."" mr majumdar also said an assessment should be made as to whether foreign investment is indeed beneficial to the country - in terms of employment and money generated - or just another way of international companies filling their deep pockets.","he said, ""no country can develop on the basis of foreign investment alone.""india has cleared a proposal allowing up to 100% foreign direct investment in its construction sector.the government proposal states that foreign investment of up to 100% will be allowed on the 'automatic route' in the construction sector, on projects including housing, hotels, resorts, hospitals and educational establishments.mr nath also announced plans to allow foreign investors to develop a smaller area of any land they acquired.mr majumdar also said an assessment should be made as to whether foreign investment is indeed beneficial to the country - in terms of employment and money generated - or just another way of international companies filling their deep pockets.analysts say improving india's infrastructure will boost foreign investment in other sectors too.previously foreign investors had to develop a much larger area, discouraging some from entering the indian market."
"candela completes bolton switch  bolton boss sam allardyce has signed roma defender vincent candela on a five-month deal.  the 31-year-old former france international gave his last press conference as a roma player on monday, anouncing his move to bolton. ""i have signed a five-month contract with bolton,"" said candela, who will travel to england on tuesday. ""in june i will decide whether to continue to play for bolton or retire from professional football."" allardyce hopes candela's arrival will relieve bolton's injury crisis after defender nicky hunt limped out injured during oldham's 1-0 win against oldham in the fa cup on sunday. ""in light of what has happened to nicky hunt, with his injury, it might be a blessing in disguise that we can bring in a highly-experienced full-back to help with our injuries at the back,"" allardyce said.

"football manager scores big time  for the past decade or so the virtual football fans among us will have become used to the annual helping of championship manager (cm). indeed, it seems like there has been a cm game for as many years as there have been pcs.  however, last year was the final time that developers sports interactive (si) and publishers eidos would work together. they decided to go their separate ways, and each kept a piece of the franchise. si kept the game's code and database, and eidos retained rights to the cm brand, and the look and feel of the game. so at the beginning of this year, fans faced a new situation. eidos announced the next cm game, with a new team to develop it from scratch, whilst si developed the existing code further to be released, with new publishers sega, under the name football manager. so what does this mean? well, football manager is the spiritual successor to the cm series, and it has been released earlier than expected. at this point cm5 looks like it will ship early next year. but given that football manager 2005 is by and large the game that everybody knows and loves, how does this new version shape up?  a game like fm2005 could blind you with statistics. it has an obscene number of playable leagues, an obscene number of manageable teams and a really obscene number of players and staff from around the world in the database, with stats faithfully researched and compiled by a loyal army of fans. but that does not do justice to the game really. what we are talking about is the most realistic and satisfying football management game to ever grace the earth.  you begin by picking the nations and leagues you want to manage teams from, for instance england and scotland. that will give you a choice not just of the four main scottish leagues, but the english premiership all the way down to the conference north and south. of course you might be looking for european glory, or to get hold of abramovich's millions, in which case you can take control at chelsea, or even barcelona, real madrid, ac milan ... the list goes on a very long way. once in a team you will be told by the board what they expect of you. sometimes it is promotion, or a place in europe, sometimes it is consolidation or a brave relegation battle. it might even be a case of champions or else. obviously the expectations are linked to the team you choose, so choose wisely. then it is time to look at your squad, work out your tactics, seeing how much cash, if any, you have got to splash, having a look at the transfer market, sorting out the training schedule and making sure your backroom staff are up to it. then bring on the matches, which are once more available in the ever-improving top down 2d view. with the exception of the improved user interface on the surface, not much else seems to have changed.  however, there have been a lot of changes under the bonnet as well - things like the manager mind-games, which let you talk to the media about the opposition bosses. the match engine is also much improved, and it is more of a joy than ever to watch. in fact just about every area of the game has been tweaked, and it leads to an ever more immersive experience.  with a game that is so complex and so open-ended, there are of course a few glitches, but nowhere near the sorts of problems that have blighted previous releases. with so many calculations to perform the game can take some time to process in between matches, though there have been improvements in this area. and a sport like football, which is so high profile and unpredictable itself, can never be modelled quite to everybody's satisfaction. but this time around a great deal of hard work has been put in to ensure that any oddities that do crop up are cosmetic only, and do not affect gameplay. and if there are problems further down the line, sports interactive have indicated their usual willingness to support and develop the game as far as possible. in all there are many more tweaks and improvements. if you were a fan of the previous cm games, then fm2005 might make you forget there was anything else before it. if you are new to the genre but like the idea of trying to take margate into the premiership, spurs into europe, or even putting rangers back on the top of the tree, fm2005 could be the best purchase you ever made. just be warned that the family might not see you much at christmas.  football manager 2005 out now for the pc and the mac","indeed, it seems like there has been a cm game for as many years as there have been pcs.eidos announced the next cm game, with a new team to develop it from scratch, whilst si developed the existing code further to be released, with new publishers sega, under the name football manager.but given that football manager 2005 is by and large the game that everybody knows and loves, how does this new version shape up?si kept the game's code and database, and eidos retained rights to the cm brand, and the look and feel of the game.a game like fm2005 could blind you with statistics.but that does not do justice to the game really.with so many calculations to perform the game can take some time to process in between matches, though there have been improvements in this area.well, football manager is the spiritual successor to the cm series, and it has been released earlier than expected.what we are talking about is the most realistic and satisfying football management game to ever grace the earth.if you are new to the genre but like the idea of trying to take margate into the premiership, spurs into europe, or even putting rangers back on the top of the tree, fm2005 could be the best purchase you ever made.if you were a fan of the previous cm games, then fm2005 might make you forget there was anything else before it.at this point cm5 looks like it will ship early next year.in fact just about every area of the game has been tweaked, and it leads to an ever more immersive experience.for the past decade or so the virtual football fans among us will have become used to the annual helping of championship manager (cm).football manager 2005 out now for the pc and the machowever, last year was the final time that developers sports interactive (si) and publishers eidos would work together."

"new 'yob' targets to be unveiled  fifty new areas getting special help to fight anti-social behaviour in england and wales will be named on thursday.  ten areas have already had access to special prosecutors and local experts and the government is now expanding the crackdown to more towns and cities. details of how many anti-social behaviour orders (asbos) were used in the last year are also being published. labour sees nuisance behaviour as a key election issue but critics claim the record is at best patchy. a year ago, ministers launched their anti-social behaviour plan and thursday's figures offer a progress check. they will say that in the past year more than 2,600 anti-social behaviour orders were issued by the courts - more than double the total used in the previous four years.  police have also closed 150 crack houses and issued more than 400 dispersal orders, breaking up groups of youths in public places. the 50 new pilot areas to get special attention will also receive extra government funding. exeter and cardiff are among cities who have voiced interest in being involved.  prime minister tony blair is also expected to announce new measures to strengthen the use of asbos and fixed penalty notices. there are still concerns that some areas of the country are not using the powers properly.  he is expected to say that the new figures were heartening but he would not rest until similar action was taken in all areas of the country where it was needed. ""we have not defeated this problem by any means, but shown together what can be done,"" he will say. mr blair this week defended the shake-up of the licensing laws, saying it was right to focus on troublemakers rather than treating everybody as a potential drunken nuisance.  ministers also boast of record police numbers and are speeding up plans to put in place 25,000 community support officers (csos). but researchers from leeds university warned that csos could undermine traditional bonds between police officers and communities. more work needed to be done on clarifying the role of different agencies and how they linked together before csos, they argued in a the study. critics of the government say it has announced more than 20 initiatives to tackle nuisance behaviour when the real focus should be on good policing. home office minister hazel blears also revealed this week that ""about a third"" of asbos were breached - with some people jailed and others not.","details of how many anti-social behaviour orders (asbos) were used in the last year are also being published.the 50 new pilot areas to get special attention will also receive extra government funding.fifty new areas getting special help to fight anti-social behaviour in england and wales will be named on thursday.they will say that in the past year more than 2,600 anti-social behaviour orders were issued by the courts - more than double the total used in the previous four years.he is expected to say that the new figures were heartening but he would not rest until similar action was taken in all areas of the country where it was needed.a year ago, ministers launched their anti-social behaviour plan and thursday's figures offer a progress check.critics of the government say it has announced more than 20 initiatives to tackle nuisance behaviour when the real focus should be on good policing.ministers also boast of record police numbers and are speeding up plans to put in place 25,000 community support officers (csos)."

"campbell rescues arsenal  sol campbell proved to be an unlikely match-winner to earn arsenal a hard-fought win at portsmouth.  the england defender lashed home a 25-yard shot for his first goal in 16 months to take arsenal back into second spot, five points behind chelsea. but before campbell scored the best two chances of the game fell to pompey striker ricardo fuller. in the first half he blasted wide when clear, and his control let him down in the second half when well placed. portsmouth got plenty of bodies behind the ball to deny arsenal space in the early stages. but their marking was slack at a corner and patrick vieira should have done better when the ball fell to him 16 yards out. a mistake by arjan de zeeuw let thierry henry in behind the pompey defence on 17 minutes but as he bore down on goal linvoy primus got in a saving tackle. with just fuller as an out-and-out striker, portsmouth's shape made life difficult for arsenal. but a delightful touch by robin van persie gave henry a sight of goal, although the angle was too tight for his shot to trouble jamie ashdown.  ashdown caused hearts to flutter on 28 minutes when he missed his punch at a corner and kolo toure headed just wide and, as arsenal began to press, van persie blasted over a good opportunity after henry had set him up. henry took a quick return pass from vieira but ashdown was out quickly to block, and there were some anxious seconds for pompey as the ball ran loose before matthew taylor cleared. after playing second fiddle, portsmouth should have taken the lead on 34 minutes. referee howard webb played a good advantage to allow steve stone to send gary o'neil away but, having shrugged off toure, the pompey midfielder planted his shot wide from 10 yards. as half-time approached, henry teased a shot through a ruck of players and inches wide. at the other end, fuller broke clear but failed to hit the target as toure closed him down.  fuller was given the best chance of the match so far on 48 minutes when patrik berger's break and slipped pass played him clear. but a poor first touch lost him the opportunity and even when he checked back and went down under vieira's challenge, referee webb was not interested. fuller paid the price when he gave way on 55 minutes to aiyegbeni yakubu, who returned after six weeks out with a knee injury. but it needed alert reflexes and safe handling from ashdown to cling on to van persie's shot as henry sniffed for scraps.  portsmouth were growing in confidence and keeper manuel almunia had to stand his ground to beat away a powerful shot from berger. arsenal were struggling to find their rhythm but took the lead through the unlikely source of campbell. the england defender needed little invitation as pompey backed off to stride forward and lash a ferocious shot past ashdown. arsenal might have stretched their lead two minutes later when mathieu flamini escaped his marker to flash a header wide from henry's free-kick. almunia went full length to grab berger's long-range shot, while ashdown palmed away substitute dennis bergkamp's shot.  ashdown, griffin, de zeeuw, primus, taylor, stone, o'neil, faye (berkovic 83), berger,

"oscars steer clear of controversy  the oscars nominations list has left out some of the most controversial films of the past year in favour of safer, less contentious cinema.  if best film nominees were drawn on the basis of column inches, two of the front-runners would have had to be michael moore's bush-baiting documentary fahrenheit 9/11 and mel gibson's the passion of the christ. both films polarised opinion but had critics talking, and the public turning up to see them - fahrenheit 9/11 breaking us box office records for a documentary, and the passion of the christ making more than us$370m (£196m) in the us alone. but this year's academy awards have shied away from the big name controversies, with the passion of the christ - a film accused of being anti-semitic - receiving nominations only in the 'minor' categories of cinematography, makeup and musical score.  fahrenheit 9/11 has also been overlooked, despite winning the palme d'or at the cannes international film festival in 2004.  moore's caustic documentary may have been affected by its distributors' decision to enter it in the best picture category, rather than best documentary, says tim dams, the news editor of trade magazine screen international. but he also believes the strong political viewpoint of moore's film does not sit well with the academy. ""if you look at past oscar winners and nominees, the very conservative oscar voters tend to go for very conservative, epic-style pictures. fahrenheit 9/11 didn't really fit in to that category. ""they tend to go for films like titanic, gladiator, and the lord of the rings, films with scale that often aren't too contentious,"" he said. while he said the oscar voting panel were not ""snubbing"" moore's film, he thought it was unlikely a documentary could ever seriously compete in a best film category. ""i think it's more a misjudgement by the people putting it out rather than a deliberate snub,"" he said.  the problem with mel gibson's film, he believed, was that the voting panel may have been cautious in nominating a film with dialogue in aramaic, an ancient middle eastern language.  ""hollywood doesn't tend to like foreign-language films - no-one's ever tried doing a film in a dead language,"" he said. but aside from these two films, some potentially contentious pictures have won nominations. the german film the downfall, a biopic tracing the final days of nazi leader adolf hitler in his berlin bunker, has been recognised in the best foreign film category. the film has caused some controversy in showing hitler as a fallible but human man, rather than a semi-mythical, historical monster. but mr dams said: ""it's not an inflammatory film. it has done very well in germany, and it's a film that portrays hitler as a human rather than some kind of devil or monster."" another 'contentious' film, mr dams said, has gained a nomination in the best documentary section through the force of its charm.  independent film-maker morgan spurlock may have forced fast-food giant mcdonalds to withdraw its 'super size' portions in the us after he went on a month-long diet eating nothing but mcdonalds meals - and filmed his progress.  the film has been a hit around the world. mr dams said: ""it's a political film, but it's quite fun and punky and well-paced. ""morgan spurlock is a really likeable guy. it's a very accessible film, and it doesn't beat you over the head with its views.

"borussia dortmund near bust  german football club and former european champion borussia dortmund has warned it will go bankrupt if rescue talks with creditors fail.  the company's shares tumbled after it said it has ""entered a life-threatening profitability and financial situation"". borussia dortmund has posted record losses and missed rent payments on its westfallen stadium. chief executive gerd niebaum stepped down last week and creditors are now pushing for greater control. shares in borussia dortmund, germany's only stock-market listed football club, dropped by almost 23% to 2.05 euros during early afternoon trading.  fund manager florian hamm - borussia dortmund's largest investor - said he would only invest more money in the company if he got a greater say in how it is run. ""i demand better transparency,"" he is quoted as saying by germany's manger magazin. the club has also faced calls to appoint executives from outside the club.  borussia dortmund posted a record loss of 68m euros ($89m; £47m) in the 12 months through june. it made a loss of 27.2m euros in the first half of the current fiscal year and said that total debts will increase to 134.7m euros by the middle of 2006 unless a restructuring plan is pushed through. ""this is the bill for their mismanagement over the past years,"" said hvb analyst peter-thilo halser. the club appointed an auditor, who has recommended a number of steps, including deferring the rent due on the stadium and suspending debt repayments until at least the 2006-2007 fiscal year. stephen schechter, a uk investment banker who has held talks with borussia dortmund over a possible bond sale, said the club needs a capital injection of 35m euros.

"henman to face saulnier test  british number one tim henman will face france's cyril saulnier in the first round of next week's australian open.  greg rusedski, the british number two, is in the same quarter of the draw and could face andy roddick in the second round if he beats swede jonas bjorkman. local favourite lleyton hewitt will meet france's arnaud clement, while defending champion and world number one roger federer faces fabrice santoro. women's top seed lindsay davenport drew spanish veteran conchita martinez.  henman came from two sets down to defeat saulnier in the first round of the french open last year, so he knows he faces a tough test in melbourne. the seventh seed, who has never gone beyond the quarter-finals in the year's first major and is lined up to meet roddick in the last eight, is looking forward to the match. ""he's tough player on any surface, he's got a lot of ability,"" he said. ""we had a really tight one in paris that went my way so i'm going to need to play well from the outset because he's a dangerous competitor."" switzerland's federer, seeded one, is the hot favourite having won three of the four grand slam titles in 2004. he has beaten santoro in five of their seven previous encounters, but is taking nothing for granted. ""it's a tricky match,"" federer said. ""i played him at the us open and won quite comfortably then. but you never know, if the rhythm is a bit off, he can keep you guessing and make it difficult. ""the most important thing, though, is to get used to playing five-set matches and winning them."" the 23-year-old could meet four-time champion andre agassi in the quarter-finals before meeting russian marat safin, the player he beat in last year's final.  eighth-seeded american agassi is set to play a qualifier in round one if he can shake off a hip injury which ruled him out of the kooyong classic. second seed andy roddick will open his campaign against irakli labadze of georgia. the american could meet rusedski in the second round, seventh seed henman in the quarter-finals and hewitt in the last four. hewitt is hoping to become the first australian man to win the event since mark edmondson in 1976. the 23-year-old has never been beyond round four in eight attempts at melbourne park but has at least secured the opposite half of the draw to federer, who beat him in the australian open, wimbledon and us open last year. safin, seeded four, opens his campaign against a qualifier with 16th seed tommy haas, the player he beat in the semi-finals in 2002, a possible fourth-round opponent.  in the women's draw, davenport could encounter eighth-seeded venus williams in the

"firefox browser takes on microsoft  microsoft's internet explorer has a serious rival in the long-awaited firefox 1.0 web browser, which has just been released.  few people get excited when some new software is released, especially when the program is not a game or a music or movie player. but the release of the first full version of firefox has managed to drum up a respectable amount of pre-launch fervour. fans of the software have banded together to raise cash to pay for an advert in the new york times announcing that version 1.0 of the browser is available. the release of firefox 1.0 on 9 november might even cause a few heads to turn at microsoft because the program is steadily winning people away from the software giant's internet explorer browser.  firefox has been created by the mozilla foundation which was started by former browser maker netscape back in 1998. much of the development work done since then has gone into firefox which made its first appearance under this name in february. earlier incarnations, but which had the same core technology, were called phoenix and firebird. since then the software has been gaining praise and converts, not least because of the large number of security problems that have come to light in microsoft's internet explorer. rivals to ie got a boost in late june when two us computer security organisations warned people to avoid the microsoft program to avoid falling victim to a serious vulnerability.  internet monitoring firm websidestory has charted the growing population of people using the firefox browser and says it is responsible for slowly eroding the stranglehold of ie. before july this year, according to websidestory, internet explorer was used by about 95% of web surfers. that figure had remained static for years. in july the ie using population dropped to 94.7% and by the end of october stood at 92.9%. the mozilla foundation claims that firefox has been downloaded almost eight million times and has publicly said it would be happy to garner 10% of the windows- using, net-browsing population. firefox is proving popular because, at the moment, it has far fewer security holes than internet explorer and has some innovations lacking in microsoft's program. for instance, firefox allows the pages of different websites to be arranged as tabs so users can switch easily between them. it blocks pop-ups, has a neat way of finding text on a page and lets you search through the pages you have browsed.  one of the most powerful features of firefox is the many hundreds of extras, or extensions, produced for it. the mozilla foundation is an open source organisation which means that the creators of the browser are happy for others to play around with the core code for the program. this has resulted in many different add-ons or extensions for the browser which now include everything from a version of the familiar google toolbar to a homeland security monitor that keep users aware of current threat levels. firefox, which used to be called firebird and before that phoenix, also has a growing number of vocal net-based fans. a campaign co-ordinated by the spread firefox website attempted to raise the $50,000 needed for a full page advert in the new york times. the campaign set itself a target of recruiting 2500 volunteers. ten days in to the campaign 10,000 people had signed up and now about $250,000 has been raised. the ad is due to run sometime in a three-week period in late november/early december. the surplus cash will be used to help keep the mozilla foundation running. microsoft is facing a growing challenge to ie's hold on the web using population. from alternative browsers such as opera, safari, amaya and even netscape.","microsoft's internet explorer has a serious rival in

"parties warned over 'grey vote'  political parties cannot afford to take older uk voters for granted in the coming election, says age concern.  a survey for the charity suggests 69% of over-55s say they always vote in a general election compared with just 17% of 18 to 24 year olds. charity boss gordon lishman said if a ""decisive blow"" was struck at the election it would be by older voters who could be relied on to turn out. a total of 3,028 adults aged 18 or over were interviewed for the study. mr lishman urged the next government to boost state pension.  he also called for measures to combat ageism and build effective public services to ""support us all in an ageing society"". ""older people want to see manifesto commitments that will make a difference to their lives,"" mr lishman said.

"petrol duties frozen, brown says  chancellor gordon brown has announced a freeze on fuel duty in his pre-budget speech to the commons on thursday.  mr brown told the house that government policy is to raise fuel duty at least in line with inflation each year to fulfil environmental commitments. but this financial year, because of ""volatility in the oil market"", he said the duty would be frozen. during 2000 many motorists campaigned against the rises but environmentalists believe less duty means more pollution. he said: ""it is our policy that each year fuel duties should rise at least in line with inflation as we seek to meet our targets for reducing polluting emmissions and fund our public services. ""but this financial year because of the sustained volatility in the oil market i propose to match the freeze in car vehicle licence duty with a continuation on the freeze on the main road fuel duties.""  the rac welcomed the news, calling it an ""early christmas present"" for motorists. but the organisation urged drivers to continue to shop around to get the best price for petrol. environmental group transport 2000 said the freeze sends the wrong message to motorists. ""we are concerned that although britain leads the world in rhetoric about climate change it often fails in practical action,"" said a spokesman. in 2000 the people's fuel lobby caused chaos by blocking roads with slow-moving convoys after mr brown threatened to raise fuel taxes. the chancellor did not raise duty that year, but despite threats of more protests in 2003, he added 1.28p per litre.","mr brown told the house that government policy is to raise fuel duty at least in line with inflation each year to fulfil environmental commitments.""but this financial year because of the sustained volatility in the oil market i propose to match the freeze in car vehicle licence duty with a continuation on the freeze on the main road fuel duties.""he said: ""it is our policy that each year fuel duties should rise at least in line with inflation as we seek to meet our targets for reducing polluting emmissions and fund our public services.but this financial year, because of ""volatility in the oil market"", he said the duty would be frozen.chancellor gordon brown has announced a freeze on fuel duty in his pre-budget speech to the commons on thursday."
"economy 'strong' in election year  uk businesses are set to prosper during the next few months - but this could trigger more interest rate rises, according to a report.  optimism is at its highest since 1997 and business will reap the benefits of a continuing rise in public spending, say researchers at bdo stoy hayward. the bank of england is expected to keep rates on hold this week - but they could go up later in the year. rates are likely to rise after the anticipated general election in may. the bdo optimism index - a leading indicator of gdp growth two quarters ahead edged up in january to 102.5, from 102.2 in october. the rise is due, in part, to an increase in public spending and increased merger and acquisition activity.  the only thing blighting business optimism this year will be uncertainties associated with the general election, bdo said. its bdo's output index - which predicts gdp movements a quarter in advance - remained at 100.8 for january, implying gdp growth at 2.9% in the second quarter of 2005. however, the output index is being held back by recent interest rate rises, sterling's strength against the dollar and high oil prices, the group noted. its inflation index, which has risen continuously over the last 8 months, climbed to 110.0 in january from 108.0 in october last year. ""the uk is looking strong going into the general election, but businesses need to prepare themselves for a jolt ahead as the bank of england reacts to growth and inflationary pressures,"" said peter hemington, partner at bdo stoy hayward.

"eu fraud clampdown urged  eu member states are failing to report fraud and irregularities in eu funds on a consistent basis, the uk's public spending watchdog has said.  the national audit office said although the latest figures showed reported fraud was falling, the eu still had no common definition of fraud. it also expressed concern that, for the 10th year, the european court of auditors had qualified the eu accounts. the nao urged the government to push for improvements in reporting fraud. it said member states needed to be more accountable on how money was spent. the report said: ""member states still do not report fraud and other irregularities to the european anti-fraud office on a consistent basis.

"ukip's secret weapon?  by any measure, new yorker dick morris is that thing americans love over everything else - a winner.  this is the man who, some pundits believe, was almost single-handedly responsible for bill clinton's sensational 1992 comeback victory. but morris is no ideologue. he has worked as election strategist for any number of republicans as well and, more recently, politicians from mexico to uruguay. now he is back in london as the uk independence party's not-so-secret electoral weapon after returning from the ukraine where he helped - you guessed it - opposition candidate viktor yushchenko. if there is one regular criticism levelled at morris, it is that he is too ready to switch allegiances. that he enjoys the game more than the politics.  so why britain and why ukip which, despite its recent eu election successes, is not likely to pull off a sensational victory in the looming general election. on this subject, morris appears almost evangelical.  ""i was on a cruise in the mediterranean and, coincidentally, so was ukip leader roger knapman. ""i had just written a piece saying how the english channel was now wider than the atlantic which he liked and it went from there"". but what is it about ukip that particularly attracts him? many might think it is simply another chance to practice his art, irrespective of the politics. ""i think the greatest threat to democracy in the world is not terrorism but bureaucratism"". a great soundbite, but a surprise coming from a new yorker post 11 september. ""it is the growth of these bodies composed of experts who know better, who don't believe in letting democracy govern but believe in letting the correct solution be determined. ""that's international bankers, the world trade organisation, the international monetary fund, the world bank and, primarily, the european union"".  so he is out to help ukip take britain out of this organisation which he believes is unreformable and inherently undemocratic. and he is scathing of the tory party which he also appears to believe is unreformable. ""the tory party is schizophrenic about europe. but until somebody says they are willing to leave the eu they can't possibly re-negotiate anything (as michael howard is pledged to do). ""it's like walking into a liquor store with a gun to rob it and saying: 'before i can proceed with the robbery i want to make clear i am not going to shoot anybody'"". possibly a very american analogy, but another great soundbite. ""the basic point is that the eu seeks political integration to move the entire nexus of decision making away from britain - and we oppose that and the tories cannot be trusted to oppose it"".  so is ukip's job to destroy the tories, as former member robert kilroy-silk once notoriously declared? ""no. the aim of ukip is to withdraw from the eu and if it has any relation to the tories it is to stiffen the tories' spine on the issue by having a large enough ukip vote so that we move the tories in the direction they are refusing to move.  ""but it's not just to shift the tories. i think ukip had a huge amount to do with tony blair's decision to hold a referendum on the european constitution and i think it had a huge amount to do with his refusal to go into the euro"". and, while we are on the subject of mr kilroy-silk, mr morris despatches him with another of his neat soundbites. ""robert kilroy silk is not a team player - it is a good idea our party stands for some thing and not some one"".  so what is the big plan for the general election. how will he achieve the breakthrough? ""look, we are not going to be forming the next government,"" he said. neither does ukip have to fight every seat. as with the 2004 us presidential election, he says, the outcome will be decided by a small number of swing seats - just as he believes it will in britain. so, with limited resources, the aim is to target those seats and end the day with a significant group in the commons. he also believes it is possible the internet could have a big part in the poll. ""the internet was a decisive factor in the 2004 presidential election - through blogs (individuals posting their views in online diaries). people just did it"". ""anything can happen in the next general election. there is an inherent instability at the moment. ""labour and the tories have drawn the consensus so tightly and to the left there is room for another voice"".  that might, he suggests, lead to a hung parliament with ukip and others holding the balance of power. it is a huge task, surely. but there is undoubtedly a sense that the next general election may indeed produce some surprises - even while most still believe it is labour's for the taking. ukip's performance in last year's european elections was just such a shocker and showed that mr morris may have a point about the new consensus. and after all, he has a reputation to sustain.","so why britain and why ukip which, despite its recent eu election successes, is not likely to pull off a sensational victory in the looming general election.ukip's performance in last year's european elections was just such a shocker and showed that mr morris may have a point about the new consensus.the aim of ukip is to withdraw from the eu and if it has any relation to the tories it is to stiffen the tories' spine on the issue by having a large enough ukip vote so that we move the tories in the direction they are refusing to move.""anything can happen in the next general election.so what is the big plan for the general election.but there is undoubtedly a sense that the next general election may indeed produce some surprises - even while most still believe it is labour's for the taking.as with the 2004 us presidential election, he says, the outcome will be decided by a small number of swing seats - just as he believes it will in britain.so he is out to help ukip take britain out of this organisation which he believes is unreformable and inherently undemocratic.i think ukip had a huge amount to do with tony blair's decision to hold a referendum on the european constitution and i think it had a huge amount to do with his refusal to go into the euro"".and he is scathing of the tory party which he also appears to believe is unreformable.""i was on a cruise in the mediterranean and, coincidentally, so was ukip leader roger knapman.and, while we are on the subject of mr kilroy-silk, mr morris despatches him with another of his neat soundbites.on this subject, morris appears almost evangelical.""the internet was a decisive factor in the 2004 presidential election - through blogs (individuals posting their views in online diaries).but what is it about ukip that particularly attracts him?neither does ukip have to fight every seat.but morris is no ideologue.many might think it is simply another chance to practice his art, irrespective of the politics.""labour and the tories have drawn the consensus so tightly and to the left there is room for another voice"".he has worked as election strategist for any number of republicans as well and, more recently, politicians from mexico to uruguay."

"camera phones are 'must-haves'  four times more mobiles with cameras in them will be sold in europe by the end of 2004 than last year, says a report from analysts gartner.  globally, the number sold will reach 159 million, an increase of 104%. the report predicts that nearly 70% of all mobile phones sold will have a built-in camera by 2008. improving imaging technology in mobiles is making them an increasingly ""must-have"" buy. in europe, cameras on mobiles can take 1.3 megapixel images. but in japan and asia pacific, where camera phone technology is much more advanced, mobiles have already been released which can take 3.2 megapixel images. japan still dominates mobile phone technology, and the uptake there is huge. by 2008, according to gartner, 95% of all mobiles sold there will have cameras on them.  camera phones had some teething problems when they were first launched as people struggled with poor quality images and uses for them, as well as the complexity and expense of sending them via mms (multimedia messaging services). this has changed in the last 18 months. handset makers have concentrated on trying to make phones easier to use. realising that people like to use their camera phones in different ways, they have introduced more design features, like rotating screens and viewfinders, removable memory cards and easier controls to send picture messages.  mobile companies have introduced more ways for people to share photos with other people. these have included giving people easier ways to publish them on websites, or mobile blogs - moblogs. but the report suggests that until image quality increases more, people will not be interested in printing out pictures at kiosks. image sensor technology inside cameras phones is improving. the gartner report suggests that by mid-2005, it is likely that the image resolution of most camera phones will be more than two megapixels. consumer digital cameras images range from two to four megapixels in quality, and up to six megapixels on a high-end camera. but a lot of work is being done to make camera phones more like digital cameras. some handsets already feature limited zoom capability, and manufacturers are looking into technological improvements that will let people take more photos in poorly-lit conditions, like nightclubs. other developments include wide-angle modes, basic editing features, and better sensors and processors for recording film clips.  images from camera phones have even made it into the art world. an exhibition next month in aid of the charity mencap, will feature snaps taken from the camera phones of top artists.  the exhibition, fonetography, will feature images taken by photographers david bailey, rankin and nan goldin, and artists sir peter blake, tracey emin and jack vettriano. but some uses for them have worried many organisations. intel, samsung, the uk's foreign office and lawrence livermore national laboratories in the us, have decided to ban camera phones from their buildings for fear of sensitive information being snapped and leaked. many schools, fitness centres and local councils have also banned them over fears about privacy and misuse. italy's information commissioner has also voiced concern and has issued guidelines on where and how the phones can be used. but camera phone fears have not dampened the manufacturers' profits. according to recent figures, sony ericsson's profits tripled in the third-quarter because of new camera phones. over 60% of mobiles sold during the three months through to september featured integrated cameras, it said.","the report predicts that nearly 70% of all mobile phones sold will have a built-in camera by 2008.image sensor technology inside cameras phones is improving.by 2008, according to gartner, 95% of all mobiles sold there will have cameras on them.but in japan and asia pacific, where camera phone technology is much more advanced, mobiles have already been released which can take 3.2 megapixel images.the gartner report suggests that by mid-2005, it is likely that the image resolution of most camera phones will be more than two megapixels.but camera phone fears have not dampened the manufacturers' profits.in europe, cameras on mobiles can take 1.3 megapixel images.four times more mobiles with cameras in them will be sold in europe by the end of 2004 than last year, says a report from analysts gartner.images from camera phones have even made it into the art world.but a lot of work is being done to make camera phones more like digital cameras.camera phones had some teething problems when they were first launched as people struggled with poor quality images and uses for them, as well as the complexity and expense of sending them via mms (multimedia messaging services).consumer digital cameras images range from two to four megapixels in quality, and up to six megapixels on a high-end camera.realising that people like to use their camera phones in different ways, they have introduced more design features, like rotating screens and viewfinders, removable memory cards and easier controls to send picture messages."
"turkey-iran mobile deal 'at risk'  turkey's investment in iran's mobile industry looks set to be scrapped after its biggest mobile firm saw its investment there slashed by mps.  iran's parliament voted by a large majority to cut turkcell's stake in a new mobile network from 70% to 49%. the move, which was justified on national security grounds, follows an earlier vote by mps to give themselves a veto over foreign investments. turkcell said the decision ""increases the risks"" attached to the project. although the company's statement said it would continue to monitor developments, observers said they thought turkcell was set to pull out of the $3bn deal. ""the possibility of carrying out this project is next to zero,"" said atinc ozkan, analyst at finans investment in istanbul. if turkcell does back out, mtn - the south african firm which lost out in the original tender - may well be back in the running. the company has said it is prepared to accept a minority stake if iran will award it the mobile deal.  turkcell's mobile deal is the second turkish investment in iran to run into trouble. turkish-austrian consortium tav was chosen to build and run tehran's new imam khomeini international airport - but the army closed it just hours after it opened in may 2004. in both cases, the justification has been national security, amid allegations that the turkish firms are too close to israel. the hardline posture taken by parliament, which is dominated by religious conservatives, could yet impact other inward investments.","turkcell's mobile deal is the second turkish investment in iran to run into trouble.the company has said it is prepared to accept a minority stake if iran will award it the mobile deal.turkey's investment in iran's mobile industry looks set to be scrapped after its biggest mobile firm saw its investment there slashed by mps.although the company's statement said it would continue to monitor developments, observers said they thought turkcell was set to pull out of the $3bn deal.iran's parliament voted by a large majority to cut turkcell's stake in a new mobile network from 70% to 49%."

"microsoft launches its own search  microsoft has unveiled the finished version of its home-grown search engine.  the now formally launched msn search site takes the training wheels off the test version unveiled in november 2003. the revamped engine indexes more pages than before, can give direct answers to factual questions, and features tools to help people create detailed queries. microsoft faces challenges establishing itself as a serious search site because of the intense competition for queries.  google still reigns supreme as the site people turn to most often when they go online to answer a query, keep up with news or search for images. but in the last year google has faced greater competition than ever for users as old rivals, such as yahoo and microsoft, and new entrants such as amazon and blinkx, try to grab some of the searching audience for themselves. this renewed interest has come about because of the realisation that many of the things people do online begin with a search for information - be it for a particular web page, recipe, book, gadget, news story, image or anything else. microsoft is keen to make its home-grown search engine a significant rival to google. to generate its corpus of data, microsoft has indexed 5 billion webpages and claims to update its document index every two days - more often than rivals. the microsoft search engine can also answer specific queries directly rather than send people to a page that might contain the answer.  for its direct answer feature, microsoft is calling on its encarta encyclopaedia to provide answers to questions about definitions, facts, calculations, conversions and solutions to equations. tony macklin, director of product at ask jeeves, pointed out that its search engine has been answering specific queries this way since april 2003. ""the major search providers have moved beyond delivering only algorithmic search, so in many ways microsoft is following the market,"" he said. tools sitting alongside the msn search engine allow users to refine results to specific websites, countries, regions or languages. microsoft is also using so-called ""graphic equalisers"" that let people adjust the relevance of terms to get results that are more up-to-date or more popular. the company said that user feedback from earlier test versions had been used to refine the workings of the finished system. the test, or beta, version of the msn search engine unveiled in november had a few teething troubles. on its first day many new users keen to try it were greeted with a page that said the site had been overwhelmed.","microsoft has unveiled the finished version of its home-grown search engine.the microsoft search engine can also answer specific queries directly rather than send people to a page that might contain the answer.microsoft is keen to make its home-grown search engine a significant rival to google.the test, or beta, version of the msn search engine unveiled in november had a few teething troubles.""the major search providers have moved beyond delivering only algorithmic search, so in many ways microsoft is following the market,"" he said.microsoft faces challenges establishing itself as a serious search site because of the intense competition for queries.the now formally launched msn search site takes the training wheels off the test version unveiled in november 2003.google still reigns supreme as the site people turn to most often when they go online to answer a query, keep up with news or search for images."
"executive trio leave aer lingus  three senior executives of ireland's state-owned airline, aer lingus, are set to leave early on 28 january after accusations of a conflict of interest.  the trio are chief executive willie walsh, chief financial officer brian dunne and chief operations officer seamus kearney. the three have refused to confirm reports they plan to launch a private airline in competition with aer lingus. they announced in november they would quit in may, but did not give a reason. that decision had followed an announcement by irish prime minister bertie ahern - who is still considering the future of the airline - which ruled out a proposed management buy-out of aer lingus. mr walsh denied they had been forced out early because of the reports claiming they were set to launch a competitor airline.  ""what i do after i leave aer lingus is still too early to say,"" mr walsh told ap news agency on wednesday. ""i have opportunities open to me. brian and seamus are in the equally fortunate position."" he said he had received more than 40 business proposals, mostly aviation-related, since the trio announced their resignations two months ago. mr walsh said there was no conflict of interest, and, if he was to launch a rival airline or join an existing competitor, ""this thing happens in every business"".

"film production 'falls' 40% in uk  the number of british films produced in the uk fell 40% in 2004, with movies starring johnny depp and jude law among those affected, screen daily has said.  twenty-seven british films were made in the uk last year following a drop in funding, compared with 45 in 2003, according to the trade weekly. it attributed the drop to tighter tax laws and reduced funding from sources such as the national lottery. uk and us co-productions in britain fell from 102 in 2003 to 81 last year.  last year the government closed tax loopholes that many film investors had taken advantage of to fund films in the uk. several projects were shelved as they faced the implications of this clampdown, coupled with the reduction in movie funding from traditional sources including the lottery and miramax films. shooting on period drama tulip fever, which was to star jude law and keira knightley, was postponed indefinitely while shooting of the libertine starring johnny depp was moved to the isle of man.  ""there isn't anything coming in to replace (the funds),"" said the libertine's executive producer marc samuelson. ""we are in a hiatus."" films with ""medium"" budgets of up to £9m, a similar level to box office hits vera drake, calendar girls and enduring love, are expected to be worst hit by the tax clampdown. the strength of the pound against the dollar is expected to have resulted in a fall in the number of us films shot in the uk during 2004, screen international added. big budget co-productions, such as the harry potter series, continued to be shot in the uk, however. the uk film council said the drop was partly due to 2003 being an especially good year for british film production, when bridget jones: the edge of reason, wimbledon and thunderbirds were all filmed in the uk.  ""the drop was expected as there was no way 2003's record level of production could be bettered,"" the council's spokesperson said.

""i was really shocked, i had no warning,"" ms simonetti told bbc news online. ""i never thought i would get in trouble because of the blog. i thought if they had a problem, someone would have said something before taking action."" the issue has highlighted concerns amongst the growing blogging community about conflicts of interest, employment law and free speech on personal websites. ms simonetti was suspended on 25 september pending an investigation and has since lodged a complaint with the us equal employment opportunity commission (eeoc). a spokesperson for delta airlines told bbc news online: ""all i can tell you is we do not discuss internal employee issues with the media."" she added she could not say whether a similar situation over personal websites had occurred in the past.  ms simonetti started her personal blog in january to help her get over her mother's death. she had ensured she made no mention of which airline she worked for, and created fictional names for cities and companies. the airline's name was changed to anonymous airline and the city in which she was based was called quirksville. a large part of the blog contained fictional stories because queen of the sky developed over the months as a character in her own right, according to ms simonetti.  the images were taken from a digital camera she had inherited from her mother.

""there are many examples of employees who have presented some kind of material online that have gotten them in trouble with employers,"" he said. it was crucial that any policy about what was and what was not acceptable was expressed clearly, was reasonable, and enforced fairly in company policy.

""i guess it's just a television show but we always think it's a bit more.' the orchestra strikes up more than 110 times during the average oscars show. as well as playing the presenters and winners on and off stage, it also performs during the commercial breaks to entertain the live audience in the house.  ""it's a very busy evening, it takes a certain amount of preparation of music, orchestrating, sketching rehearsing, before the show. but you don't know what the unexpected will be and as the musical director, it's exciting,"" explains conti. and much of the preparation goes into mastering scores that will never be performed. ""we don't know who the winners will be. so when they say, 'the winner is', we have five different pieces of music in front of us, they say the name, we play the appropriate one immediately,"" adds conti.  the orchestra is often called upon to play when the winners ramble on too long during their acceptance speeches, despite being told to be brief by the show's producers.  the decision to drown out or 'kill' the offending star with music is relayed from the director's box to the orchestra via conti's earpiece. ""i don't feel good about it at all. it's not my call though,"" he says. ""when the director says 'music' the orchestra plays and he takes a long shot of the hall. we don't usually see the person speaking while his microphone is cut off. ""the person that's been cut off, who's 10 feet from me, is glaring at me like it's death time."" on occasions, some stars have taken it upon themselves to send a warning shot across the bows of the musical director before they start to speak. ""julia roberts, when she came on, she asked me to not get ready to play because she had so much to do,"" he says. conti received an oscar in 1983 for the original score of the right stuff. he also received two nominations in the original song category in 1976 for gonna fly now from rocky and in 1981 for the title song from for your eyes only.  ""it's a moment in the sun,"" he says. ""when people get up there, some people, this is hard to believe, people that spend their lives in front of the camera or audiences entertaining, might get a little flustered. ""but there's this moment in time when the biggest award that they could possibly get in their life has been handed to them and they're either not in control or they want to thank everyone that they ever met.""  the image of the oscars telecast is one of slick presentation and smooth transitions between performances and the award categories. behind the scenes, the key players, such as conti, have a bewildering array of technical props to deal with. ""there's a big script and video monitors you have to watch and there are also audio controls. i can control hearing in my ears, the left ear or the right ear - different things at different times.  ""i have to communicate with the director. i have a little microphone that's attached to my headset. to open up that microphone, i have a footswitch,"" he explains. conti's most nerve-wracking moment came during his first oscars show as musical director, in 1977, when a member of the orchestra alerted him that they could smell smoke. conti immediately told the show's director: ""i start cursing and screaming, i tell him we're not going to die for this show - you must do something or i'm going to climb out of this pit with 60 musicians and we're going to be home in 10 minutes. ""'oh no bill don't do anything,"" came the response. ""imagine these elegantly dressed ladies and gentlemen of the orchestra, 60 or so of them in the pit and while we're playing, firemen with their helmets and their hatchets crawling among us trying to find the reason for the smoke."" the smell turned out to be new paint smouldering on the music stands. ""no one died, it's not a big story, but it was scary at the time,"" laughs conti. when the ceremony is over, the music director attends the annual governor's ball with his family. ""i have a drink and relive the show,"" he says. ""i'm not for too much carousing. i go home and unwind. it takes me about a day.""","conti's most nerve-wracking moment came during his first oscars show as musical director, in 1977, when a member of the orchestra alerted him that they could smell smoke.""when the director says 'music' the orchestra plays and he takes a long shot of the hall.but you don't know what the unexpected will be and as the musical director, it's exciting,"" explains conti.bill conti's job of musical director of the oscars show is not for the faint-hearted since conducting the orchestra is the ultimate plate-spinning assignment.the orchestra strikes up more than 110 times during the average oscars show.so when they say, 'the winner is', we have five different pieces of music in front of us, they say the name, we play the appropriate one immediately,"" adds conti.""julia roberts, when she came on, she asked me to not get ready to play because she had so much to do,"" he says.""i have a drink and relive the show,"" he says.conti immediately told the show's director: ""i start cursing and screaming, i tell him we're not going to die for this show - you must do something or i'm going to climb out of this pit with 60 musicians and we're going to be home in 10 minutes.""we don't know who the winners will be.""it's a very busy evening, it takes a certain amount of preparation of music, orchestrating, sketching rehearsing, before the show.we don't usually see the person speaking while his microphone is cut off.""but there's this moment in time when the biggest award that they could possibly get in their life has been handed to them and they're either not in control or they want to thank everyone that they ever met.""""it's a moment in the sun,"" he says.""i have to communicate with the director.when the ceremony is over, the music director attends the annual governor's ball with his family.""no one died, it's not a big story, but it was scary at the time,"" laughs conti.the orchestra is often called upon to play when the winners ramble on too long during their acceptance speeches, despite being told to be brief by the show's producers."
"blair defends terror law changes  the prime minister has defended measures to allow house arrest without trial, saying ""several hundred"" people in the uk are plotting terror attacks.  the government is facing opposition from tory and lib dem mps and its own backbenchers as it prepares for the final commons debate on the changes. but tony blair said there could be no concession on the ""basic principle"". mr blair told the bbc the ""control orders"" would only be used in the most limited circumstances. critics in the opposition and civil rights activists are worried that the home secretary will have the power to issue the detention orders. but the government has so far resisted pressure for judges to be responsible for making the orders, instead saying judges will be able to quash them.  an explanation is being sent by home secretary charles clarke to all mps and peers ahead of the final debate in the house of commons. on sunday, conservative shadow home secretary david davis claimed judges would get the powers to issue detention orders. and liberal democrat leader charles kennedy said some concessions had already been offered by the government during last-minute negotiations. some 32 labour mps voted against the legislation last week. barbara follett, whose first husband was killed while under house arrest in south africa during the apartheid era, confirmed she would vote against the government.  but the government is continuing to insist that ""control orders"" must be issued by the home secretary. mr blair told bbc radio 4's woman's hour: ""we are being advised by the police and the security services... ""what they say is you have got to give us powers in between mere surveillance of these people - there are several hundred of them in this country who we believe are engaged in plotting or trying to commit terrorist acts - you have got to give us power in between just surveying them and being able, being sure enough of the proof, to prosecute them beyond reasonable doubt. ""and these will be restrictions on their liberty that we will use only in the most limited circumstances.""  a yougov poll in the daily telegraph suggested 75% of respondents thought action was sometimes necessary against people who had not committed an offence but who had been found by intelligence services to be planning a terrorist attack. but tory leader michael howard told bbc news that the government was again making a mistake in ""rushing"" anti-terrorism legislation. ""i very much hope it would be possible to reach a compromise on this."" he said after meeting tony blair he had been left with the impression that ""he really wasn't interested in any of the various proposals we have put forward"". mr clarke wants house arrest and other powers to replace indefinite jail for terror suspects - something the law lords have ruled against on the basis that it breaches human rights. bbc political correspondent vicky young said some form of concession on the measures was likely to be needed to get the legislation through the house of lords, where labour does not have a majority and would require support from other parties. shami chakrabarti, director of civil liberties pressure group liberty, said who was able to issue the control orders was not the main issue. she said the legislation was ""a travesty and a perversion of justice"" and would remain ""unpalatable"" even if a judge was involved early in the process.","mr blair told the bbc the ""control orders"" would only be used in the most limited circumstances.bbc political correspondent vicky young said some form of concession on the measures was likely to be needed to get the legislation through the house of lords, where labour does not have a majority and would require support from other parties.on sunday, conservative shadow home secretary david davis claimed judges would get the powers to issue detention orders.she said the legislation was ""a travesty and a perversion of justice"" and would remain ""unpalatable"" even if a judge was involved early in the process.shami chakrabarti, director of civil liberties pressure group liberty, said who was able to issue the control orders was not the main issue.but tory leader michael howard told bbc news that the government was again making a mistake in ""rushing"" anti-terrorism legislation.but the government is continuing to insist that ""control orders"" must be issued by the home secretary.barbara follett, whose first husband was killed while under house arrest in south africa during the apartheid era, confirmed she would vote against the government.critics in the opposition and civil rights activists are worried that the home secretary will have the power to issue the detention orders."
"chinese wine tempts italy's illva  italy's illva saronno has agreed to buy 33% of changyu, the largest wine maker in china.  changyu said in a statement to the shenzhen stock exchange that illva will pay 481.42m yuan ($58.16m; £30.7m), once the government approves the deal. the italian liqueur maker will acquire the shares from the yantai state asset management bureau. chinese wine sales are growing, the us agriculture department said, with wine sales in 2003 up 25% at 61.1bn yuan.  china is encouraging state-owned companies to sell shares to foreign investors. anheuser-busch, heineken and scottish & newcastle have all invested in the chinese beer industry in the last two years and now illva saronno is betting on the chinese wine market. yantai state asset management bureau - a government agency in the north-eastern city of yantai - owns 55% of changyu. the state agency will also sell 10% of its stake in changyu to another overseas company, although it didn't say who. the remaining 12% will be retained by the yantai city government. the consumption of wine in china is still low, at just 0.22 litres per capita, said the us agriculture department. this compares with 59 litres in france, 12 litres in the us and three litres in japan.","yantai state asset management bureau - a government agency in the north-eastern city of yantai - owns 55% of changyu.the consumption of wine in china is still low, at just 0.22 litres per capita, said the us agriculture department.italy's illva saronno has agreed to buy 33% of changyu, the largest wine maker in china.chinese wine sales are growing, the us agriculture department said, with wine sales in 2003 up 25% at 61.1bn yuan.the italian liqueur maker will acquire the shares from the yantai state asset management bureau."
"brown to outline presidency goals  next year will be ""make or break"" for development in poorer countries gordon brown will say as he sets out uk goals for its eu and g8 presidencies.  the chancellor is due to outline a series of key targets the government will be judged on in 2005. they will include doubling aid from donor countries and eliminating debt owed by the poorest nations. mr brown also wants other g8 nations to match his target for overseas aid - spending 0.7% of national income.  he also wants the richer countries to do more to help the development of vaccines for aids and malaria. the chancellor is travelling to america next week as part of his persuasion drive over the issue. he told bbc radio 4's today programme: ""we need more resources allied to progress on trade and progress on debt relief if we are going to make an impact on the problems of ill health, of illiteracy, of poverty, particularly in africa but right through the developing countries.""  his proposals were effectively a new ""marshall plan"" for the world, including an international finance facility, which would issue bonds in an attempt to double global aid cash to $100bn a year. agreement in the doha development talks could also give developing nations the trading ability they needed, he argued. the european union's common agricultural policy had caused aggravated trade problems, he said, but there was now an agreement to end export subsidies.  mr brown said much had been achieved on issues such as debt relief in the last seven years. but with 30,000 children were dying unnecessarily every day more was needed, including 100% debt relief multilaterally. ""that is why next year is a test,"" he said. ""if after five years of making promises the world is not prepared to honour them, then people will be justified in saying they promised but they did not produce results."" the catholic aid agency cafod will host mr brown's speech on wednesday.  cafod wants britain to use its influence to pressure countries like the us to make firm commitments to tackle global poverty. mr brown said america too needed to take more action but defended president george bush for guaranteeing resources to countries which introduced reforms to tackle corruption. oxfam's paying the price report this week said 45 million children will die needlessly before 2015 and aid budgets are half their 1960 levels. the charity's director, barbara stocking, said: ""2005 offers the chance for an historic breakthrough, but unless world leaders act now the year will end in shameful failure."" the report said the g8 of top industrialised nations had agreed in 1970 to spend 0.7% of their incomes on aid.  but 34 years later none of the organisations members had reached this target and many had not yet set a timetable. mr blair, who has described africa as a ""scar"" on the world's conscience, has already said tackling world poverty would be one his g8 priorities along with climate change and the aids epidemic. but band aid founder bob geldof in july said he was sick of hearing ""guff"" about scars on the world. it was pathetic that britain was the 4th richest country in the world but only the 11th most generous aid donor, he added. conservative shadow international development secretary alan duncan accused mr brown of missing his target on providing anti-retroviral drug treatment to three million africans by 2005. instead, only 500,000 people would benefit, he said. ""there's no point in him demanding praise and adulation for setting a whole new raft of targets when he has so woefully failed to meet the ones he already has,"" added mr duncan.","mr brown also wants other g8 nations to match his target for overseas aid - spending 0.7% of national income.""that is why next year is a test,"" he said.mr brown said much had been achieved on issues such as debt relief in the last seven years.the report said the g8 of top industrialised nations had agreed in 1970 to spend 0.7% of their incomes on aid.but band aid founder bob geldof in july said he was sick of hearing ""guff"" about scars on the world.mr brown said america too needed to take more action but defended president george bush for guaranteeing resources to countries which introduced reforms to tackle corruption.mr blair, who has described africa as a ""scar"" on the world's conscience, has already said tackling world poverty would be one his g8 priorities along with climate change and the aids epidemic.next year will be ""make or break"" for development in poorer countries gordon brown will say as he sets out uk goals for its eu and g8 presidencies.it was pathetic that britain was the 4th richest country in the world but only the 11th most generous aid donor, he added.his proposals were effectively a new ""marshall plan"" for the world, including an international finance facility, which would issue bonds in an attempt to double global aid cash to $100bn a year.oxfam's paying the price report this week said 45 million children will die needlessly before 2015 and aid budgets are half their 1960 levels."

"healthsouth ex-boss goes on trial  the former head of us medical services firm healthsouth overstated earnings and assets to boost the company's share price, it was claimed in court.  richard scrushy, 52, is accused of ""directing"" a $2.7bn (£1.4bn) accounting fraud at the company he co-founded in alabama in 1984. prosecutors said he was motivated by wealth - spending about $200m between 1996 and 2002 while earning much less. defence lawyers said mr scrushy had been deceived by other executives. several former healthsouth employees have already pleaded guilty to fraud and are expected to give evidence against mr scrushy.  ""we will present evidence that richard scrushy knew about the conspiracy, that he participated in the conspiracy and that he profited,"" prosecutor alice martin told the court. mr scrushy is the first chief executive to be tried for breaching the sarbanes oxley act - a law introduced in the wake of the enron and worldcom frauds which obliges corporate bosses to vouch for the accuracy of their companies' results. among the charges he faces are conspiracy to commit fraud, filing false statements and money laundering. after federal agents raided healthsouth's offices in march 2003, the company said none of its past financial statements could be relied on. the firm has since reorganised its board and management team and currently operates about 1,400 health clinics.","several former healthsouth employees have already pleaded guilty to fraud and are expected to give evidence against mr scrushy.defence lawyers said mr scrushy had been deceived by other executives.richard scrushy, 52, is accused of ""directing"" a $2.7bn (£1.4bn) accounting fraud at the company he co-founded in alabama in 1984.""we will present evidence that richard scrushy knew about the conspiracy, that he participated in the conspiracy and that he profited,"" prosecutor alice martin told the court."
"building giant in asbestos payout  australian building products group james hardie has agreed to pay $1.1bn (£568m) to victims of asbestos-related diseases.  the landmark deal could see thousands of people suffering from lung diseases - caused by asbestos the company once made - receive compensation. the move follows angry protests after the firm said a previous compensation fund was running out of money. a subsequent new south wales state inquiry criticised hardie's actions. in september, the inquiry found that the company had misled the public about the amount of money set aside to cover its asbestos-related liabilities, sparking the resignation of its then chief executive, peter macdonald.  campaigners welcomed news of the preliminary agreement.

"security scares spark browser fix  microsoft is working on a new version of its internet explorer web browser.  the revamp has been prompted by microsoft's growing concern with security as well as increased competition from rival browsers. microsoft said the new version will be far less vulnerable to the bugs that make its current browser a favourite of tech-savvy criminals. test versions of the new program, called ie 7, are due to be released by the summer.  the announcement about internet explorer was made by bill gates, microsoft chairman and chief software architect, during a keynote speech at the rsa security conference currently being held in san francisco. although details were scant, mr gates, said ie7 would include new protections against viruses, spyware and phishing scams. this last category of threats involves criminals setting up spoof websites that look identical to those of banks and try to trick people into handing over login and account information.  in a bid to shore up the poor security in ie 6, microsoft has regularly issued updates to patch loopholes exploited by criminals and the makers of nuisance programs such as spyware. earlier this month it released a security bulletin that patched eight critical security holes - some of which were found in the ie browser. microsoft has also made a series of acquisitions of small firms that specialise in computer security. one of the first fruits of these acquisitions appeared last month with the release of a microsoft anti-spyware program. an own-brand anti-virus program is due to follow by the end of 2005. the decision to make internet explorer 7 is widely seen as a u-turn because, before now, microsoft said it had no need to update the browser. typically new versions of its browser appear with successive versions of the windows operating system. a new version of ie was widely expected to debut with the next version of windows, codenamed longhorn, which is due to appear in 2006. the current version of internet explorer is four years old, and is widely seen as falling behind rivals such as firefox and opera. there are also persistent rumours that search engine google is poised to produce its own brand browser based on firefox. in particular the firefox browser has been winning fans and users since its first full version was released in november 2004. estimates of how many users firefox has won over vary widely. according to market statistics gathered by websidestory, firefox's market share is now about 5% of all users. however, other browser stat gatherers say the figure is closer to 15%. some technical websites report that a majority of their visitors use the firefox browser. internet explorer still dominates with a share of about 90% but this is down from a peak of almost 96% in mid-2004.","microsoft is working on a new version of its internet explorer web browser.the decision to make internet explorer 7 is widely seen as a u-turn because, before now, microsoft said it had no need to update the browser.in particular the firefox browser has been winning fans and users since its first full version was released in november 2004.microsoft said the new version will be far less vulnerable to the bugs that make its current browser a favourite of tech-savvy criminals.typically new versions of its browser appear with successive versions of the windows operating system.a new version of ie was widely expected to debut with the next version of windows, codenamed longhorn, which is due to appear in 2006.test versions of the new program, called ie 7, are due to be released by the summer.the current version of internet explorer is four years old, and is widely seen as falling behind rivals such as firefox and opera.in a bid to shore up the poor security in ie 6, microsoft has regularly issued updates to patch loopholes exploited by criminals and the makers of nuisance programs such as spyware.earlier this month it released a security bulletin that patched eight critical security holes - some of which were found in the ie browser."

""we don't have a titanic or a lord of the rings out there. i think it's fair to say it does concern us a bit,"" said academy executive director bruce davis. about 51 million people in the us have seen this year's nominees, compared with between 100 million and 118 million in recent years. the last time combined attendance was so low was in 1984 when amadeus beat the killing fields, a passage to india, places in the heart and a soldier's story to best picture, when 41 million saw the five films. last year's ceremony attracted the highest audience in four years as viewers tuned in to see lord of the ring: return of the king sweep the board.  and the show reaped its biggest audience in 1997 when titanic took home 11 oscars.  the film had taken $500m (£264m) worldwide before the ceremony, and eventually took $1.8bn (£952m). ""eyeballs starring at the movie screen translates to eyeballs staring at the tv screen,"" said paul dergarabedian of box office tracker exhibitor relations. ""people like to have a vested interest in what they're watching. ""when titanic does $1.8bn in worldwide box office, you've got a lot of people with a vested interest."" past years have also seen blockbusters such as saving private ryan, forrest gump and ghost compete for oscars. the biggest box office hitter among this year's nominees is the aviator, which has taken $90m (£48m) in the us, although takings in the uk have reached only £7m so far.  low-budget move sideways and finding neverland have so far grossed about $45m (£24m) each. the year's biggest blockbusters do actually feature in the oscar nominees but in the animation category. shrek 2 and the incredibles took $436m (£231m) while the incredibles took $259m (£137m). mel gibson's the passion of the christ, which took $370m (£196m) in the us, was largely ignored by academy voters.  but many in the film industry do not equate award and box office success. ""i have never equated the academy awards with how much money a movie takes in,"" said nikki rocco, head of distribution at universal which released nominee ray. ""that's the people's choice awards. this is not about the public. this is about the industry bestowing awards on what they think are the best films of the year.""","the biggest box office hitter among this year's nominees is the aviator, which has taken $90m (£48m) in the us, although takings in the uk have reached only £7m so far.this year's clutch of oscar nominees have been the least popular for 20 years according to box office figures.""when titanic does $1.8bn in worldwide box office, you've got a lot of people with a vested interest.""in the us the five nominated for best film have been seen by 50% fewer people than movies in previous years.but many in the film industry do not equate award and box office success.while the awards are not based on box office popularity there is concern for the ratings of the televised ceremony.the film had taken $500m (£264m) worldwide before the ceremony, and eventually took $1.8bn (£952m).about 51 million people in the us have seen this year's nominees, compared with between 100 million and 118 million in recent years.this is about the industry bestowing awards on what they think are the best films of the year.""and the show reaped its biggest audience in 1997 when titanic took home 11 oscars."

"civil servants in strike ballot  the uk's biggest civil service union is to ballot its 290,000 members on strikes in protest at government plans to extend their pension age to 65.  the public and commercial services union will co-ordinate any action with up to six other public sector unions. unions have already earmarked 23 march for a one-day strike which could involve up to 1.4 million uk workers. the government says unions will be consulted before any changes are made to the pension system.  pcs leader mark serwotka warned there could be further walkouts unless there was a government rethink.  ""for a government that lectures everyone on choice - choice on public service, choice on this and choice on that - isn't it ironic that they're saying to public sector workers there is no choice,"" he said. ""if you want the pension you were promised when you started you must work for an extra five years - that is working until people drop. ""in the 20th century, it's completely unacceptable."" bbc correspondent stephen cape said the combined unions represented ""a formidable force"" which could embarrass the government in the run-up to the general election. a stoppage involving civil servants, in particular, could seriously disrupt or close government departments, agencies and museums, he said.  opposition to raising the retirement age is ""one thing all the unions are agreed on"", our correspondent added. unison's 800,000 workers, the transport and general workers' union's 70,000 and amicus' 20,000 are among those being balloted about a 23 march walkout. deputy prime minister john prescott held a private meeting with senior union figures on thursday night. our correspondent said that he understood no deal had been offered in that meeting but that there was room for further negotiations. there was ""some possibility"" of the strike action being avoided, he added.","bbc correspondent stephen cape said the combined unions represented ""a formidable force"" which could embarrass the government in the run-up to the general election.the uk's biggest civil service union is to ballot its 290,000 members on strikes in protest at government plans to extend their pension age to 65.the government says unions will be consulted before any changes are made to the pension system.the public and commercial services union will co-ordinate any action with up to six other public sector unions.pcs leader mark serwotka warned there could be further walkouts unless there was a government rethink.unions have already earmarked 23 march for a one-day strike which could involve up to 1.4 million uk workers."
"howard unveils election platform  the conservatives would stand up for the ""forgotten majority"", michael howard pledged as he unveiled the first part of the tory election manifesto.  the tory leader argued there was a mass of people whom he says feel let down by tony blair and who share tory values. in the foreword to the manifesto, he promises to focus on restoring order, trying to lower taxes and giving power back to the people. labour says the document offers only a return to a ""failed tory past"". the liberal democrats say the conservatives cannot win what they predict will be a three-party contest.  campaigning activity is accelerating ahead of the general election, which is widely tipped for may but could be any time before june 2006. labour on monday postponed a launch of election posters because of the asian tsunami disaster. mr howard published the introduction to the tory manifesto. other chapters will follow in coming weeks.  in a speech in northamptonshire, he said the ""forgotten majority"" made up the backbone of britain. they were people who were saving for their first home or their retirement, working hard and accepting their responsibilities. he says in the manifesto foreword: ""they have been forgotten, neglected and taken for granted by mr blair.""  saying britain must change direction, mr howard argues government is too big and cannot continue ""down the path of ever rising taxes"". he promises to ensure frontline professionals, parents and patients make the key decisions rather than whitehall ""bureaucrats"". and he says the tories would get a grip on crime, immigration and disorder. ""the decline of responsibility and the proliferation of so-called 'human rights' have left us in a moral quagmire, unable to get a grip on rising crime and disorder,"" he says.  mr howard says he will produce a timetable for action so people can hold him to account but on issues like taxation he has so far only published options, not specific plans. mr howard told bbc news: ""i'm determined to lower taxes but i'm also determined not to make any promises i can't keep."" the tories were unveiling material months ahead of the expected election because they needed time to make voters aware of their policies, he said. he was asked if tory support for the government on iraq and identity cards had given the lib dems the chance to portray themselves as the opposition to labour. mr howard argued the only test for his policies was whether they were best for britain. it had nothing to do with putting ""clear blue water"" between himself and his opponents.  labour's election slogan will be: ""britain's working, don't let the tories wreck it again"". campaign coordinator alan milburn accused the tories of ""launching thatcherism in instalments"" while labour helped the hard working majority of families. lib dem president simon hughes said his party had set out its election stance in september.

"tobacco giants hail court ruling  us tobacco companies have welcomed an appeal court's decision to reject the government's $280bn (£155bn) claim for alleged deceit about smoking dangers.  tobacco stocks rose sharply on wall street after the 2-1 decision. the court in washington found the case - filed by the clinton administration in 1999 - could not be brought under federal anti-racketeering laws. anti-smoking groups urge the government to fight on, but the justice department has not said if it will appeal. among the accused were altria group, rj reynolds tobacco, lorillard tobacco, liggett group and brown and williamson. they were delighted by the decision, which sent reynolds shares up 4.5% and altria shares up 5.11%.  charles a blixt, executive vice-president of rj reynolds tobacco, said the ruling ""dramatically transforms"" the government's lawsuit. altria group said, in a statement, the government now ""must not only prove that the companies have engaged in fraudulent behaviour in the past, but that they are likely to do so in the future.""  the government had claimed tobacco firms    - manipulated nicotine levels to increase addiction   - targeted teenagers with multi-billion dollar advertising campaigns   - lied about the dangers of smoking and ignored research to the contrary.     prosecutors wanted the cigarette firms to ""disgorge"" $280bn in profits accumulated over the past 50 years and impose tougher rules on marketing their products. they brought the case under racketeering laws, which were passed to deny mafia gangs the profits of their crimes. but the tobacco companies denied that they illegally conspired to promote smoking and defraud the public. they also said they had already met many of the government's demands in a landmark $206bn settlement reached with 46 states in 1998. the three-judge panel in the district of columbia's court of appeals ruled on friday that the us government could not sue the firms under the anti-racketeering laws. judge david sentelle, in his ruling, said such laws were aimed at putting an end to illegal conduct going forward.

""this cannot be perpetuated in movies."" shooting on the sequel is expected to begin in april, with hundreds of dominicans applying to be extras in the movie.  about 3,000 caribs live on the island of dominica, which has a population of 70,000. many caribs were killed by disease and war during colonisation up to the 1600s. mr williams said he had received support from indigenous groups around the world in his efforts to have cannibalism references removed from the film. but he admitted there were some members of the carib council who did not support the campaign. he said some did not ""understand our history, they are weak and are not committed to the cause of the carib people"". the first pirates of the caribbean film took $305m (£162m) at the box office in the us alone. the cast and crew are to work on two sequels back-to-back, with the first to be released in 2006.","carib chief charles williams said talks with disney's producers revealed there was ""a strong element of cannibalism in the script which cannot be removed"".the caribbean island's government said disney planned to film in dominica.plans to portray dominica's carib indians as cannibals in the sequel to hit film pirates of the caribbean have been criticised by the group's chief.mr williams said he had received support from indigenous groups around the world in his efforts to have cannibalism references removed from the film.the first pirates of the caribbean film took $305m (£162m) at the box office in the us alone.he said some did not ""understand our history, they are weak and are not committed to the cause of the carib people""."
"citizenship event for 18s touted  citizenship ceremonies could be introduced for people celebrating their 18th birthday, charles clarke has said.  the idea will be tried as part of an overhaul of the way government approaches ""inclusive citizenship"" particularly for ethnic minorities. a pilot scheme based on ceremonies in australia will start in october. mr clarke said it would be a way of recognising young people reaching their voting age when they also gain greater independence from parents. britain's young black and asian people are to be encouraged to learn about the nation's heritage as part of the government's new race strategy which will also target specific issues within different ethnic minority groups. officials say the home secretary wants young people to feel they belong and to understand their ""other cultural identities"" alongside being british. the launch follows a row about the role of faith schools in britain. on monday school inspection chief david bell, accused some islamic schools of failing to teach pupils about their obligations to british society.  the muslim council of britain said ofsted boss mr bell's comments were ""highly irresponsible"". the home office started work on its community cohesion and race equality strategy last year and the outcome, launched on wednesday, is called 'improving opportunity, strengthening society'. it is aimed at tackling racism, exclusion, segregation and the rise in political and religious extremism.

"blair backs 'pre-election budget'  tony blair has backed chancellor gordon brown's pre-budget report amid opposition claims he was too bullish about the state of the uk economy.  in a speech in edinburgh, the prime minister said thursday's report reinforced stability and opportunity. and that would be central to labour's next election campaign, planning for which was already well advanced. mr brown earlier denied his economic forecasts were too optimistic - but refused to rule out future tax rises.  he told bbc radio 4's today programme: ""no politician should make the mistake that john major and his colleagues made in 1992 of saying no matter what the circumstances are, they can make all sorts of guarantees on every individual thing.  ""that is not what politicians should do, it would not be responsible to do."" mr brown insisted his spending plans were ""affordable"" and he could afford to be optimistic because britain was now a stable, low-inflation economy and house prices were now stabilising. mr blair praised his chancellor for his role in creating economic stability, which he said was the ""cornerstone"" of labour's programme.  in a speech at edinburgh's napier university, he said labour would publish over the next few months ""a rich agenda for future policy in any possible third term"".  ""in every area of work there is a detailed plan for the future, much clearer than those in 1997 or 2001. all of it fits together around common themes of opportunity, security and stability for all,"" mr blair said. in his pre-budget report, mr brown surprised some city experts by forecasting uk growth at between 3% and 3.5% for next year. many believe the figure is more likely to be under 3% - and fear tax rises or spending cuts, saying tax receipts have been overestimated. carl emmerson, from the institute for fiscal studies, told bbc news: ""he thinks everything will come out in the wash and it will, in fact, be ok. we're not so sure."" david page, of investec securities, said: ""his forecast that he will meet the golden rule with a margin of £8bn is way too optimistic.

"weak dollar trims cadbury profits  the world's biggest confectionery firm, cadbury schweppes, has reported a modest rise in profits after the weak dollar took a bite out of its results.  underlying pre-tax profits rose 1% to £933m ($1.78bn) in 2004, but would have been 8% higher if currency movements were stripped out. the owner of brands such as dairy milk, dr pepper and snapple generates more than 80% of its sales outside the uk. cadbury said it was confident it would hit its targets for 2005. ""while the external commercial environment remains competitive, we are confident that we have the strategy, brands and people to deliver within our goal ranges in 2005,"" said chief executive todd stitzer.  the modest profit rise had been expected by analysts after the company said in december that the poor summer weather had hit soft drink sales in europe.  cadbury said its underlying sales were up by 4% in 2004. growth was helped by its confectionery brands - including cadbury, trident and halls - which enjoyed a ""successful"" year, with like-for-like sales up 6%. drinks sales were up 2% with strong growth in us carbonated soft drinks, led by dr pepper and diet drinks, offset by the weaker sales in europe. cadbury added that its fuel for growth cost-cutting programme had saved £75m in 2004, bringing total cost savings to £100m since the scheme began in mid-2003. the programme is set to close 20% of the group's factories and shed 10% of the workforce. cadbury schweppes employs more than 50,000 people worldwide, with about 7,000 in the uk.","cadbury said its underlying sales were up by 4% in 2004.cadbury said it was confident it would hit its targets for 2005.growth was helped by its confectionery brands - including cadbury, trident and halls - which enjoyed a ""successful"" year, with like-for-like sales up 6%.the modest profit rise had been expected by analysts after the company said in december that the poor summer weather had hit soft drink sales in europe.cadbury schweppes employs more than 50,000 people worldwide, with about 7,000 in the uk."
"anti-tremor mouse stops pc shakes  a special adaptor that helps people with hand tremors control a computer mouse more easily has been developed.  the device uses similar ""steady cam"" technology found in camcorders to filter out shaking hand movements. people with hand tremors find it hard to use conventional mice for simple computer tasks because of the erratic movements of the cursor on the screen. about three million britons have some sort of hand tremor condition, said the uk national tremor foundation. ""using a computer mouse is well known for being extremely hard for people with tremors so we're delighted to hear that a technology has been developed to address this problem,"" said karen walsh, from the uk national tremor foundation. most commonly associated with tremors is parkinson's disease, but they can also be caused by other conditions like essential tremor (et). tremors more often affect older people, but can hit all ages. et, for example, is genetic and can afflict people throughout their lives.  the assistive mouse adapter (ama) is the brainchild of ibm researcher jim levine who developed the prototype after seeing his uncle, who has parkinson's disease, struggle with mouse control. ""i knew that there must be way to improve the situation for him and the millions of other tremor sufferers around the world, including the elderly.  ""the number of elderly computer users will increase as the population ages, and at the same time, the need for computer access grows,"" he said. computer users plug the device into a pc, and it can be adjusted depending on how severe the tremor is. it is also able to recognise multiple clicking on a mouse button caused by shaky digits. ibm said it would partner up with a small uk-based electronics firm, montrose secam, to produce the devices which will cost about £70. james cosgrave, one of the company's directors, said it would make a big difference to those with tremors. ""i'm a pilot and my tremor condition has not limited my ability to fly a plane,"" he said. ""but using a pc has proven almost impossible simply because everything revolves around using the mouse to accurately manipulate the tiny cursor on the screen."" he said a prototype of the gadget had transformed his life.  the device could help open up computing to millions more people who have found shaking to be a barrier. last year, the office for national statistics reported that for the first time, more than half of all households in britain had a home computer. with prices getting cheaper to get online too, computer ownership is increasing. but although 62% of british people have tried the internet, only 15% of britons aged 65 or over have been online. more than six million uk households now have a broadband net. by the middle of 2005, it is estimated that 50% of all uk net users will be on broadband. there are still millions using the net through dial-up connections too.","""using a computer mouse is well known for being extremely hard for people with tremors so we're delighted to hear that a technology has been developed to address this problem,"" said karen walsh, from the uk national tremor foundation.a special adaptor that helps people with hand tremors control a computer mouse more easily has been developed.about three million britons have some sort of hand tremor condition, said the uk national tremor foundation.people with hand tremors find it hard to use conventional mice for simple computer tasks because of the erratic movements of the cursor on the screen.computer users plug the device into a pc, and it can be adjusted depending on how severe the tremor is.""the number of elderly computer users will increase as the population ages, and at the same time, the need for computer access grows,"" he said.""i'm a pilot and my tremor condition has not limited my ability to fly a plane,"" he said.most commonly associated with tremors is parkinson's disease, but they can also be caused by other conditions like essential tremor (et).the device could help open up computing to millions more people who have found shaking to be a barrier.more than six million uk households now have a broadband net."

"minister hits out at yukos sale  russia's renationalisation of its energy industry needs to be reversed, a senior government figure has warned.  economy minister german gref told the kommersant newspaper that direct state involvement in oil was ""unjustified"". his comments follow the sale of much of oil giant yukos to cover back taxes - a deal which effectively took most of the firm's assets into public ownership. on 28 december, another senior economic adviser called the sale ""the swindle of the century"". yuganskneftegaz, the unit which produced 60% of yukos' output, had been seized and sold in december for less than $10bn to a previously unknown firm called baikal.  baikal promptly passed into the hands of state-controlled firm rosneft, itself shortly to merge with state gas giant gazprom. ""we used to see street hustlers do this kind of thing,"" andrei illarionov - then economic adviser to president vladimir putin - told a press conference. ""now officials are doing it."" within days, he was stripped of most of his responsibilities.  mr gref, a well-known opponent of nationalisation in competitive parts of the market, was keen to distance himself from mr iliaronov's comments. the privatisation of companies such as yukos in the 1990s had been badly handled, he said. but he stressed that the government needed to get out of oil. ""i think that rosneft and yuganskneftegaz, should it become a state-owned company, must be privatized,"" he said.  ""today our government is ineffective and state companies, as a result, are for the overwhelming part ineffective as well."" and he warned that using back taxes to deal with firms like yukos - a technique now being applied by the kremlin to several other firms - was a mistake. ""if we follow that logic, we should nationalise all businesses,"" he said. many large russian companies, particularly in the energy sector, use complex webs of offshore companies to avoid taxes.  mr gref also poured cold water on president putin's promises of doubled economic growth within a decade. the assault on yukos' assets has been widely blamed for a slowdown in economic growth in recent months. ""the task is not simply to double gdp; instead it is to use gdp to qualitatively improve people's lives,"" mr gref told kommersant. ""we don't need simply to increase gdp, but to improve its structure."" instead of focusing on headline growth figures, russia needed to focus on better institutions, such as a more efficient - and less corrupt - court system.","""the task is not simply to double gdp; instead it is to use gdp to qualitatively improve people's lives,"" mr gref told kommersant.economy minister german gref told the kommersant newspaper that direct state involvement in oil was ""unjustified"".and he warned that using back taxes to deal with firms like yukos - a technique now being applied by the kremlin to several other firms - was a mistake.the privatisation of companies such as yukos in the 1990s had been badly handled, he said.mr gref also poured cold water on president putin's promises of doubled economic growth within a decade.his comments follow the sale of much of oil giant yukos to cover back taxes - a deal which effectively took most of the firm's assets into public ownership.the assault on yukos' assets has been widely blamed for a slowdown in economic growth in recent months.yuganskneftegaz, the unit which produced 60% of yukos' output, had been seized and sold in december for less than $10bn to a previously unknown firm called baikal.mr gref, a well-known opponent of nationalisation in competitive parts of the market, was keen to distance himself from mr iliaronov's comments."

"bush budget seeks deep cutbacks  president bush has presented his 2006 budget, cutting domestic spending in a bid to lower a record deficit projected to peak at $427bn (£230bn) this year.  the $2.58 trillion (£1.38 trillion) budget submitted to congress affects 150 domestic programmes from farming to the environment, education and health. but foreign aid is due to rise by 10%, with more money to treat hiv/aids and reward economic and political reform. military spending is also set to rise by 4.8%, to reach $419.3bn. the budget does not include the cost of running military operations in iraq and afghanistan, for which the administration is expected to seek an extra $80bn from congress later this year.  congress will spend several months debating george w bush's proposal.  the state department's planned budget would rise to just under $23bn - a fraction of the defence department's request - including almost $6bn to assist us allies in the ""war on terror"". however, the administration is keen to highlight its global effort to tackle hiv/aids, the bbc's jonathan beale reports, and planned spending would almost double to $3bn, with much of that money going to african nations. mr bush also wants to increase the amount given to poorer countries through his millennium challenge corporation. the scheme has been set up to reward developing countries that embrace what the us considers to be good governance and sound policies. yet mr bush's proposed spending of $3bn on that project is well below his initial promise of $5bn.  a key spending line missing from proposals is the cost of funding the administration's proposed radical overhaul of social security, the pensions programme on which many americans rely for their retirement income.  some experts believe this could require borrowing of up to $4.5 trillion over a 20-year period. neither does the budget include any cash to purchase crude oil for the us emergency petroleum stockpile. concern over the level of the reserve, created in 1970s, has led to rises in oil prices over the past year. the bush administration will instead continue to fill the reserve by taking oil - rather than cash - from energy companies that drill under federal leases.  the outline proposes reductions in budgets at 12 out of 23 government agencies including cuts of 9.6% at agriculture and 5.6% at the environmental protection agency. the spending plan for the year beginning 1 october is banking on a healthy us economy to boost government income by 6.1% to $2.18 trillion. spending is forecast to grow by 3.5% to $2.57 trillion. but the budget is still the tightest yet under mr bush's presidency. ""in order to sustain our economic expansion, we must continue pro-growth policies and enforce even greater spending restraint across federal government,"" mr bush said in his budget message to congress. mr bush has promised to halve the us's massive budget deficit within five years. the deficit, partly the result of massive tax cuts early in mr bush's presidency, has been a key factor in pushing the us dollar lower. the independent congressional budget office estimates that the shortfall could shrink to little more than $200bn by 2009, returning to the surpluses seen in the late 1990s by 2012. but its estimates depend on the tax cuts not being made permanent, in line with the promise when they were passed that they would ""sunset"", or disappear, in 2010. most republicans, however, want them to stay in place. and the figures also rely on the ""social security trust fund"" - the money set aside to cover the swelling costs of retirement pensions - being offset against the main budget deficit.","president bush has presented his 2006 budget, cutting domestic spending in a bid to lower a record deficit projected to peak at $427bn (£230bn) this year.yet mr bush's proposed spending of $3bn on that project is well below his initial promise of $5bn.military spending is also set to rise by 4.8%, to reach $419.3bn.the budget does not include the cost of running military operations in iraq and afghanistan, for which the administration is expected to seek an extra $80bn from congress later this year.the state department's planned budget would rise to just under $23bn - a fraction of the defence department's request - including almost $6bn to assist us allies in the ""war on terror"".""in order to sustain our economic expansion, we must continue pro-growth policies and enforce even greater spending restraint across federal government,"" mr bush said in his budget message to congress.mr bush has promised to halve the us's massive budget deficit within five years.but the budget is still the tightest yet under mr bush's presidency.the deficit, partly the result of massive tax cuts early in mr bush's presidency, has been a key factor in pushing the us dollar lower.the spending plan for the year beginning 1 october is banking on a healthy us economy to boost government income by 6.1% to $2.18 trillion.the $2.58 trillion (£1.38 trillion) budget submitted to congress affects 150 domestic programmes from farming to the environment, education and health."
"looks and music to drive mobiles  mobile phones are still enjoying a boom time in sales, according to research from technology analysts gartner.  more than 674 million mobiles were sold last year globally, said the report, the highest total sold to date. the figure was 30% more than in 2003 and surpassed even the most optimistic predictions, gartner said. good design and the look of a mobile, as well as new services such as music downloads, could go some way to pushing up sales in 2005, said analysts. although people were still looking for better replacement phones, there was evidence, according to gartner, that some markets were seeing a slow-down in replacement sales.  ""all the markets grew apart from japan which shows that replacement sales are continuing in western europe,"" mobile analyst carolina milanesi told the bbc news website. ""japan is where north america and western european markets can be in a couple of years' time. ""they already have tv, music, ringtones, cameras, and all that we can think of on mobiles, so people have stopped buying replacement phones.""  but there could be a slight slowdown in sales in european and us markets too, according to gartner, as people wait to see what comes next in mobile technology. this means mobile companies have to think carefully about what they are offering in new models so that people see a compelling reason to upgrade, said gartner. third generation mobiles (3g) with the ability to handle large amounts of data transfer, like video, could drive people into upgrading their phones, but ms milanesi said it was difficult to say how quickly that would happen. ""at the end of the day, people have cameras and colour screens on mobiles and for the majority of people out there who don't really care about technology the speed of data to a phone is not critical."" nor would the rush to produce two or three megapixel camera phones be a reason for mobile owners to upgrade on its own. the majority of camera phone models are not at the stage where they can compete with digital cameras which also have flashes and zooms.  more likely to drive sales in 2005 would be the attention to design and aesthetics, as well as music services. the motorola razr v3 phone was typical of the attention to design that would be more commonplace in 2005, she added. this was not a ""women's thing"", she said, but a desire from men and women to have a gadget that is a form of self-expression too. it was not just about how the phone functioned, but about what it said about its owner. ""western europe has always been a market which is quite attentive to design,"" said ms milanesi.  ""people are after something that is nice-looking, and together with that, there is the entertainment side.

"mobile gaming takes off in india  gaming on the move is one of the fastest-growing activities among the tech-savvy in india, says a report.  the indian mobile gaming market is expected to generate about $26m (£13.8m) by the end of 2004, according to market analysts in-stat/mdr. in october, mobile phone users grew by 1.4 million to 44.9 million, overtaking the number of landlines, said the telecom regulatory authority of india. analysts say cheap rates and a huge youth market is driving the market. india has a large population of under-25s, and many in urban areas are fast adopting mobiles as must-have gadgets.  india's mobile gaming market will bring in about $336m (£178m) by 2009, according to the report. mobile gaming is expected to explode globally over the next few years. analysts predict that 220 million people will be playing games on phones by 2009, generating billions for mobile companies.  services other than just voice calls which are offered by mobile operators in india have, as a result of the huge rise in subscribers, grown significantly and rapidly.

"barkley fit for match in ireland  england centre olly barkley has been passed fit for sunday's six nations clash with ireland at lansdowne road.  barkley withdrew from bath's team for friday's clash with gloucester after suffering a calf injury in training. gloucester centre henry paul has also been cleared to play after overcoming an ankle injury. england coach andy robinson, who names his team on wednesday, has called up bath prop duncan bell following phil vickery's broken arm. with vickery sidelined for at least six weeks and julian white out with a neck injury, bell could make his england debut. bell, 30, had set his sights on an international career with wales. but last december, the international rugby board confirmed that he could only be eligible for england as he had travelled on tour with them in 1998. ""i thought i'd burned all my bridges with england when i expressed an interest in wanting to play for wales, so it's fantastic to get this opportunity,"" he said. bell, who featured in the england a side which beat france 30-20 10 days ago, added: ""i recognise that i got into the england a squad because of injuries. ""and it's the same again in getting into the senior squad. but now that i have this opportunity i intend to take it fully if selected and play my heart out for my country.""  england coach andy robinson could take a gamble and call inexperienced sale sharks prop andrew sheridan into his front row. but sheridan favours the loosehead side of the scrum and a more likely scenario is for uncapped bell - who was among the try-scorers when england a beat france a 30-20 nine days ago - to be drafted in.","bell, who featured in the england a side which beat france 30-20 10 days ago, added: ""i recognise that i got into the england a squad because of injuries.with vickery sidelined for at least six weeks and julian white out with a neck injury, bell could make his england debut.england coach andy robinson, who names his team on wednesday, has called up bath prop duncan bell following phil vickery's broken arm.but sheridan favours the loosehead side of the scrum and a more likely scenario is for uncapped bell - who was among the try-scorers when england a beat france a 30-20 nine days ago - to be drafted in.england coach andy robinson could take a gamble and call inexperienced sale sharks prop andrew sheridan into his front row.england centre olly barkley has been passed fit for sunday's six nations clash with ireland at lansdowne road."
"defection timed to hit tax pledge  with impeccable and precisely-calculated timing, tory defector robert jackson and his new labour bosses have attempted to overshadow michael howard's latest announcement on taxation and spending.  with just about everyone in westminster now working towards a may general election, mr howard is eager to map out some clear and distinctive policies aimed at finally shifting the tories' resolutely depressing poll showings. the big idea is his £35bn savings on waste and bureaucracy which mr howard has pledged to plough back into public services and tax cuts. and it was virtually certain his pledge on tax cuts was meant to be the core message from his interview on the bbc one's breakfast with frost programme. he and his shadow chancellor oliver letwin have been edging towards an announcement on this front for some months now, but without any concrete pledges. but mr howard announced that, of the £35bn he has earmarked from savings, £12bn will be used to plug labour's claimed financial black hole with any left over going to tax cuts in mr letwin's first budget. he would not be precise, but there are already suggestions he is set to announce lifting the threshold on income tax and reforming or abolishing inheritance tax. but he did, for the first time, say there would be such tax cuts.  ""at this election, people will have a clear choice between mr blair who will waste more and tax more and the conservative party which will give value for money and tax less"". it is the tories' attempt to open that famed ""clear blue water"" between them and the labour party and return to a traditional tory agenda that will both reassure the middle england voters who have abandoned him and appeal to core conservative voters. so it is a pretty safe bet to assume that, when robert jackson finally decided to jump ship and swim over to the labour benches, his new masters decided to time the announcement for the greatest possible impact. mr howard, however, was dismissive. ""these things happen from time to time. there are disagreements between robert jackson and me.  ""the election is not going to be decided on what robert jackson did,"" he added. and that is certainly true. the election will be decided on ""the economy stupid"". other issues like the iraq war and the ""trust"" thing will also play a major part. but it is the economy that will probably be the greatest influence over the way people finally vote. and many on the tory benches have been crying out for mr howard to get back onto the old tory tax cuts agenda. mr howard knows that risks accusations that, as a result, he would slash public services, so he has attempted to shoot that fox first. with polls suggesting voters would rather any government cash surpluses were spent on schools and hospitals before tax cuts, he has suggested that is exactly what he will do. whether this will finally be enough to shift those polls remains to be seen.","but he did, for the first time, say there would be such tax cuts.""at this election, people will have a clear choice between mr blair who will waste more and tax more and the conservative party which will give value for money and tax less"".so it is a pretty safe bet to assume that, when robert jackson finally decided to jump ship and swim over to the labour benches, his new masters decided to time the announcement for the greatest possible impact.the big idea is his £35bn savings on waste and bureaucracy which mr howard has pledged to plough back into public services and tax cuts.""the election is not going to be decided on what robert jackson did,"" he added.but mr howard announced that, of the £35bn he has earmarked from savings, £12bn will be used to plug labour's claimed financial black hole with any left over going to tax cuts in mr letwin's first budget.and many on the tory benches have been crying out for mr howard to get back onto the old tory tax cuts agenda.with just about everyone in westminster now working towards a may general election, mr howard is eager to map out some clear and distinctive policies aimed at finally shifting the tories' resolutely depressing poll showings.mr howard knows that risks accusations that, as a result, he would slash public services, so he has attempted to shoot that fox first.mr howard, however, was dismissive."

""we have the bleep machine ready, but bleeps will be used as needed,"" producer gil cates told reporters. however, he added that he strongly disapproved of the growing tendency to censor live broadcasts on us tv.  he also played down fears that rock, who is known for using strong language in his stand-up routines, might cause controversy on the night. the 40-year-old comic has already promised not to swear live on air during the show.

"iraq advice claim sparks new row  the tories say ministers must respond in parliament to claims that the legal advice used to justify the iraq war was drawn up at number 10.  downing street has denied the claims, made in a new book about the attorney general lord goldsmith's advice. lord goldsmith also denied them, saying he was not ""leaned on"" in any way. but the conservatives and liberal democrats say they want the publication of the full legal advice given by the attorney general.  the government has consistently refused to publish lord goldsmith's advice on the legality of the war - saying such papers have always been kept confidential.  but a short statement about lord goldsmith's position was presented in a written parliamentary answer on 17 march 2003 - just before a crucial commons vote on the military action. it said it was ""plain"" iraq continued to be in material breach of un resolution 1441. in his new book, lawless world, philippe sands, a qc and international law professor, suggests the parliamentary answer was written in downing street. according to mr sands, lord goldsmith had warned tony blair in a document on 7 march 2003 that the use of force against iraq could be illegal and that it would have been safer to seek a second un resolution sanctioning military action.  mr sands told newsnight the government had prepared a legal team to be able to defend its case, in case legal action was taken against the uk over the war. on 10 march, military chiefs reportedly asked for an unequivocal statement about the legality of the war to make sure troops could be defended in a court of law. the book, being serialised in the guardian newspaper, says on 13 march lord goldsmith met then home office minister lord falconer and downing street adviser baroness morgan.

""the approach is at an early stage and therefore does not require a response at this point,"" lse said. talks with the european stock market and with rival bidder deutsche boerse will continue, the lse said. last week, the group rejected a £1.3bn ($2.5bn) takeover offer from deutsche boerse, claiming that it undervalued the business. lse saw its shares surge 4.9% to a new high of 583p in early trade, following the announcement on monday.  the offer follows widespread media speculation that euronext would make an offer for lse. experts now widely expect a bidding war for europe's biggest stock market, which lists stocks with a total capitalisation of £1.4 trillion, to break out. commentators say that a deal with euronext, which owns the liffe derivatives exchange in london and combines the paris, amsterdam and lisbon stock exchanges, could potentially offer the lse more cost savings than a deal with deutsche boerse.  a weekend report in the telegraph had quoted an unnamed executive at euronext as saying the group would make a cash bid to trump deutsche boerse's offer. ""because we already own liffe in london, the cost savings available to us from a merger are far greater than for deutsche boerse,"" the newspaper quoted the executive as saying. euronext chief executive jean-francois theodore is reported to have already held private talks with lse's chief executive clara furse. further reports had suggested that euronext could make an offer in excess of the lse's 533p a share closing price on friday. however, euronext said it could not guarantee ""at this stage"" that a firm offer would be made for lse. there has been extensive speculation about a possible takeover of the company since an attempted merger with deutsche boerse failed in 2000.","commentators say that a deal with euronext, which owns the liffe derivatives exchange in london and combines the paris, amsterdam and lisbon stock exchanges, could potentially offer the lse more cost savings than a deal with deutsche boerse.pan-european stock market euronext has approached the london stock exchange (lse) about a possible takeover bid.the offer follows widespread media speculation that euronext would make an offer for lse.however, euronext said it could not guarantee ""at this stage"" that a firm offer would be made for lse.talks with the european stock market and with rival bidder deutsche boerse will continue, the lse said.a weekend report in the telegraph had quoted an unnamed executive at euronext as saying the group would make a cash bid to trump deutsche boerse's offer."
"gritty return for prince of persia  still basking in the relatively recent glory of last year's sands of time, the dashing prince of persia is back in warrior within, and in a more bellicose mood than last time.  this sequel gives the franchise a grim, gritty new look and ramps up the action and violence. as before, you control the super-athletic prince from a third-person perspective. the time-travelling plot hinges on the dahaka, an all-consuming monster pursuing our hero through the ages. the only way to dispel it is to turn back the clock again and kill the sultry empress of time before she ever creates the sands of time that caused the great beast's creation.  studiously structured though this back story is, everything boils down to old-fashioned fantasy gameplay which proves, on the whole, as dependable as it needs to be. ever since the series' then-groundbreaking beginnings on the commodore amiga, prince of persia has always been about meticulously-animated acrobatic moves, that provide an energetic blend of leaping preposterously between pieces of scenery and lopping off enemies' body parts.  those flashy moves are back in full evidence, and tremendous fun to perform and perfect. combining them at speed is the best fun, although getting a handle of doing so takes practice and plenty of skill. until you reach that point, it is a haphazard business. all too often, you will perform a stunning triple somersault, pirouette off a wall, knock out three enemies in one glorious swoop, before plummeting purposefully over a cliff to your doom. that in turn can mean getting set back an annoyingly long distance, for you can only save at the fountains dotted along the path. the expected fiendish puzzles are all present and correct, but combat is what is really been stepped up, and there is more of it than before. the game's developers have combined acrobatic flair with gruesome slaying techniques in some wonderfully imaginative ways. slicing foes down the middle is one particularly entertaining method of seeing them off.  warrior within is a very slick package; the game's intro movie is so phenomenally good that it actually does an ultimate disservice once the game itself commences.  it is on a par with the jaw-dropping opening sequence of onimusha 3 earlier this year, and when the game begins, it is something of an anti-climax. that said, the graphics are excellent, and indeed among the most striking and satisfying elements of the game. the music is probably the worst aspect - a merit-free heavy metal soundtrack that you will swiftly want to turn off. there is something strangely unsatisfying about the game. perhaps precisely because its graphics and mechanics are so good that the story and overall experience are not quite as engaging as they should be. somehow it adds up to less than the sum of its parts, and is more technically impressive than it is outright enjoyable. but that is not to say warrior within is anything other than a superb adventure that most will thoroughly enjoy. it just does not quite take the character to the new heights that might have been hoped for.","still basking in the relatively recent glory of last year's sands of time, the dashing prince of persia is back in warrior within, and in a more bellicose mood than last time.warrior within is a very slick package; the game's intro movie is so phenomenally good that it actually does an ultimate disservice once the game itself commences.the only way to dispel it is to turn back the clock again and kill the sultry empress of time before she ever creates the sands of time that caused the great beast's creation.those flashy moves are back in full evidence, and tremendous fun to perform and perfect.that in turn can mean getting set back an annoyingly long distance, for you can only save at the fountains dotted along the path.there is something strangely unsatisfying about the game.it just does not quite take the character to the new heights that might have been hoped for.ever since the series' then-groundbreaking beginnings on the commodore amiga, prince of persia has always been about meticulously-animated acrobatic moves, that provide an energetic blend of leaping preposterously between pieces of scenery and lopping off enemies' body parts.it is on a par with the jaw-dropping opening sequence of onimusha 3 earlier this year, and when the game begins, it is something of an anti-climax.that said, the graphics are excellent, and indeed among the most striking and satisfying elements of the game."
"uk plan to deport terror suspects  deals are being sought to allow the uk to deport terror suspects to their home countries without risk of them being tortured or sentenced to death.  home secretary charles clarke told the times he hoped agreement with several countries could be reached. the move follows a law lords judgement that the detention of 12 men at belmarsh prison, london, and woodhill, milton keynes, was unlawful. the 12 affected by the ruling are from algeria, tunisia, egypt and jordan. the government was told that using anti-terror legislation brought in after 11 september to hold the men indefinitely without charge broke human rights laws.  mr clarke told the times: ""i think we should be prosecuting much more energetically our ability to deport the individuals concerned to the countries from which they come."" he said it was a route that was being pursued in collaboration with foreign secretary jack straw ""in a very positive way"". mr clarke said that he was seeking ""memorandums of understanding"" between overseas governments and britain to ensure suspects would not be subjected to the death penalty on their return. however, he added: ""i do not think the solution to the law lords' judgement for this government is in deportations, but they will help. ""there are other strands that we have to do."" but the liberal democrat's shadow home secretary, mark oaten, accused mr clarke of avoiding the main issue with the belmarsh detainees.  ""the critical issue that the home secretary is dodging at this stage is to deal with the very principle, to deal with how we tackle this problem in the future,"" he told bbc news. ""and i do want him to grasp those issues and that means looking at how we can actually secure convictions in this country allowing, for example, intercept communications, telephone tapping to be included,"" mr oaten said. ""deportation may tackle this initial problem but i want to see a wider debate urgently about how we can actually get trials and convictions in this country."" ""unless we get that, the liberal democrats will vote against this measure when it comes for renewal in march.""  the bbc's home affairs correspondent, daniel sandford, said it appeared mr clarke was putting more emphasis on the possibility of deportation than his predecessor, david blunkett. but he said reaching an understanding with some of the detainees' home countries could be difficult. ""some of these people are accused of very, very serious crimes in their home countries so it's not an easy agreement to get and i think for some of these suspects it won't be the solution."" daniel sandford said ministers may try to put forward other solutions - such as allowing more secret evidence to be put into normal criminal trials or developing a more secret trials process - in the next few weeks.

"slim playstation triples sales  sony playstation 2's slimmer shape has proved popular with uk gamers, with 50,000 sold in its first week on sale.  sales have tripled since launch, outstripping microsoft's xbox, said market analysts chart-track. the numbers were also boosted by the release of the ps2-only game grand theft auto: san andreas. the title broke the uk sales record for video games in its first weekend of release. latest figures suggest it has sold more than 677,000 copies.  ""it is obviously very, very encouraging for sony because microsoft briefly outsold them last week,"" john houlihan, editor of computerandvideogames.com told bbc news. ""and with halo 2 [for xbox] out next week, it really is a head-to-head contest between them and xbox.""  although xbox sales over the last week also climbed, ps2 sales were more than double that. the figures mean sony is reaching the seven million barrier for uk sales of the console. edinburgh-based developer, rockstar, which is behind the gta titles, has seen san andreas pull in an estimated £24m in gross revenues over the weekend. in comparison, blockbuster films like harry potter and the prisoner of azkaban took £11.5m in its first three days at the uk box office. the lord of the rings: the return of the king took nearly £10m over its opening weekend, although games titles are four to five times more expensive than cinema tickets.  gangster-themed gta san andreas is the sequel to grand theft auto vice city which previously held the record for the fastest-selling video game ever. the xbox game halo 2, released on 11 november in the uk, is also widely tipped to be one of the best-selling games of the year. the original title won universal acclaim in 2001, and sold more than four million copies.  mr houlihan added that sony had done well with the ps2, but it definitely helped that the release of san andreas coincided with the slimline ps2 hitting the shelves. the run-up to christmas is a huge battlefield for games consoles and titles. microsoft's xbox had been winning the race up until last week in sales. the sales figures also suggest that it may be a largely adult audience driving demand, since gta san andreas has an 18 certificate. sony and microsoft have both reduced console prices recently and are preparing the way for the launches of their next generation consoles in 2005. ""both have hit crucial price points at around £100 and that really does open up new consoles to new audience, plus the release of two really important games in terms of development are also driving those sales,"" said mr houlihan.","the title broke the uk sales record for video games in its first weekend of release.although xbox sales over the last week also climbed, ps2 sales were more than double that.sony playstation 2's slimmer shape has proved popular with uk gamers, with 50,000 sold in its first week on sale.the sales figures also suggest that it may be a largely adult audience driving demand, since gta san andreas has an 18 certificate.the xbox game halo 2, released on 11 november in the uk, is also widely tipped to be one of the best-selling games of the year.the numbers were also boosted by the release of the ps2-only game grand theft auto: san andreas.the figures mean sony is reaching the seven million barrier for uk sales of the console.""both have hit crucial price points at around £100 and that really does open up new consoles to new audience, plus the release of two really important games in terms of development are also driving those sales,"" said mr houlihan.microsoft's xbox had been winning the race up until last week in sales."

"guantanamo four questioned  the four britons freed from us custody in guantanamo bay are expected to be allowed a visit by one relative.  moazzam begg, martin mubanga, feroz abbasi and richard belmar were held for three years, accused of al-qaeda links. mr begg's father, azmat, said he had been told he could see his son for 20 minutes and would say he was ""a hero"". the men are being held at london's paddington green police station, where they are expected to be questioned by uk anti-terror officers. but louise christian, the lawyer representing mr abbasi and mr mubanga, said the families would be reunited with the men away from the station. before being driven by police from birmingham to london, azmat begg said he was concerned for his son moazzam's mental state and was looking forward to giving him a hug. as azmat begg arrived at the london police station, there appeared to be some confusion as to the visiting arrangements. police have said they have a duty to investigate the men, who were arrested on their return to the uk. but metropolitan police commissioner sir john stevens said evidence obtained by mi5 while the four were in cuba was ""absolutely"" inadmissible in uk courts. in an interview with the independent, sir john said his officers would have to find other evidence before the suspects could be tried in the uk.  he told the newspaper: ""if an admission is made, it is a totally different ball game... it could be used as evidence. ""the options are: if there is enough evidence they will be charged. if not they will be released as soon as possible."" the men have been allowed to meet their lawyers. louise christian said that after being ""tortured and abused"" at guantanamo bay, the men's arrest was unfair and inappropriate. she told bbc news she remained very concerned about their psychological state. gareth peirce, lawyer for mr begg, said she was shocked at the condition of the men and appalled that the authorities felt the need to detain them. washington has claimed all four were ""enemy combatants"" who trained at camps run by al-qaeda. the pentagon says they were freed after the uk government promised they would not be a threat to the national security of the us or any of its allies.  the detainees were immediately arrested under section 41 of the terrorism act 2000 when they landed at raf northolt, west london, on tuesday. massoud shadjareh, from the muslim safety forum, said: ""what sort of homecoming is this? they are innocent people."" the muslim council of britain urged that the men should receive counselling and medical help.

"uk 'discriminated against roma'  the government's immigration rules racially discriminated against roma (gypsies) seeking entry into the uk, the law lords have ruled.  it follows a home office move to cut asylum claims by stopping people, mostly roma, from boarding flights to britain from the czech capital, prague. civil rights group liberty said it exposed ""racism at the heart of the government's asylum policy"". the home office said it had not meant to discriminate against anyone. it said it would look at the implications of the ruling, but pointed out the controls were no longer in place because czechs are now entitled to free movement across europe.  the screening took place at the airport in july 2001, at a time of concern about the number of asylum seekers entering britain.  those refused ""pre-clearance"" were effectively prevented from travelling to the uk, because no airline would carry them. lady hale, sitting with lords bingham, steyn, hope and carswell, said many roma had good reason to want to leave the czech republic because of persecution. but she said they were treated more sceptically than non-roma passengers by immigration officers ""acting on racial grounds"". lady hale said immigration officers should have treated all would-be passengers in the same way, only using more intrusive questioning if there was a specific reason.  liberty said statistics suggested roma czechs were 400 times more likely to be stopped by british immigration officials at prague airport than non-roma czechs. it took up the case of six unnamed roma czechs refused entry to britain, and that of the european roma rights centre, which said the measures unfairly penalised roma people. it lost a high court action in october 2002 when a judge said the system was ""no more or less objectionable"" than a visa control system. he ruled there was no obligation on britain not to take steps to prevent a potential refugee from approaching its border to claim asylum.  the court of appeal then decided the practice almost inevitably discriminated against roma, but that this was justified because they were more likely to seek asylum. immigration law allows officials to discriminate against citizens from named countries, but it does not allow officers to go further than that.  responding to the ruling, a home office spokesman said: ""the scheme was operated two years ago as a short-term response to the high levels of passengers travelling from prague who are subsequently found to be ineligible for entry to the uk.""  welcoming the ruling, maeve sherlock, chief executive of the refugee council, said: ""human rights abuses against the roma in eastern europe are well documented, and it is hugely troubling that the government sought to deny entry to such a vulnerable group."" amnesty international's jan shaw said: ""that the government's own asylum policy was being operated discriminatorily is bleakly ironic given that discrimination often lies at the heart of serious human rights abuse, not least in the czech republic."" but the chairman of migration watch uk, sir andrew green, said the house of lords decision was a ""step in the wrong direction"".

"final hunts held as ban looms  hunts in england and wales have begun on the last day that hunting with dogs is legal, with more due out later.  thousands of supporters are expected to turn out at more than 250 meets, many of which have altered their normal schedules to be out on a thursday. the ban on hunting with dogs comes into effect from 0001 gmt on friday. the countryside alliance had its latest legal bid to block the ban thwarted on wednesday when the appeal court ruled the hunting act was lawful.  but the group says hunting will continue in some form after the ban comes in, with hunts expected to test the new law to its limits. others are expected to defy the ban by continuing to hunt illegally.  anti-hunt organisations, for whom the ban is the culmination of years of campaigning, say they hope most will stay within the law. mike hobday, of the league against cruel sports, told bbc news: ""we've long urged them to go drag hunting - to follow an artificial scent - and that is what we hope they do. ""but if they continue to chase foxes, to chase wild mammals around the countryside, that's against the law and we're confident they'll be brought to justice."" at the headquarters of quorn hunt in leicestershire, feelings were running high as hunt enthusiasts prepared for their final legal hunt. bbc correspondent sarah mukherjee said hunt supporters were in tears.  she said many people did not share the countryside alliance's optimism that hunting would be able to continue. farmer geoff brooks, a senior member of the quorn hunt, told bbc news people's lives ""revolved around hunting"". he described the ban as ""ridiculous"" and ""badly thought out"" but said it would be hard for most people to defy it as they would not want to risk their incomes by getting a criminal record.  at the court of appeal on wednesday, the countryside alliance failed in its attempt to have the hunting act ruled invalid. but it says the ban is unenforceable because the law is unclear and impossible to police.  the alliance says hunt supporters will go out and test this law to its limits on saturday. the league against cruel sports and the rspca say they will monitor hunts and assist police in bringing prosecutions. the association of chief police officers has issued guidance to forces on how to deal with the new rules. a spokesman said: ""basically, it's not going to be police officers chasing about in cars across fields, it will be based on intelligence and information received as well."" the decision on how to police individual hunts will be left to local forces, with more officers sent to hunts where disruption is expected. he said police would consider evidence submitted by anti-hunt organisations on its merits.","but the group says hunting will continue in some form after the ban comes in, with hunts expected to test the new law to its limits.the alliance says hunt supporters will go out and test this law to its limits on saturday.but it says the ban is unenforceable because the law is unclear and impossible to police.the decision on how to police individual hunts will be left to local forces, with more officers sent to hunts where disruption is expected.others are expected to defy the ban by continuing to hunt illegally.the league against cruel sports and the rspca say they will monitor hunts and assist police in bringing prosecutions.the countryside alliance had its latest legal bid to block the ban thwarted on wednesday when the appeal court ruled the hunting act was lawful.she said many people did not share the countryside alliance's optimism that hunting would be able to continue.at the headquarters of quorn hunt in leicestershire, feelings were running high as hunt enthusiasts prepared for their final legal hunt."

"hewitt fights back to reach final  lleyton hewitt kept his dream of an australian open title alive with a four-set win over andy roddick in friday's second semi-final.  the home favourite will face marat safin in sunday's final after coming through 3-6 7-6 (7-3) 7-6 (7-4) 6-1. hewitt fought back from a set down and trailed in both tie-breaks but would not be denied, thrilling the melbourne crowd with a typically battling effort. he is aiming to be the first australian winner since mark edmondson in 1976. hewitt is the first australian to make the final since pat cash lost to mats wilander in 1988, but faces a huge challenge against safin - the conqueror of roger federer. after needing five sets in his last two matches there was reason to think hewitt might struggle for fitness. he certainly made a sluggish start, dropping his opening service game, and roddick dominated with his huge serve as he took the first set.  after 12 tense games in the second, the key moment came when hewitt raised his game in the tie-break to overturn an early mini-break. that energised the crowd but roddick was not finished and raced 4-1 clear in the crucial third before hewitt pegged him back and forced another tie-break. again roddick broke first and again hewitt fought back, taking the lead with a superb backhand pass.  the australian was not to be denied and a disheartened roddick made little impact in the fourth set as hewitt raced to victory, sending the melbourne crowd wild and ensuring the final will be a huge occasion. ""it's awesome,"" said hewitt. ""i started preparing for this tournament nine months ago. ""i've done a lot of hard yards to get here. ""i've always said i'd do anything to get in the first night final at the australian open. now i've got my chance."" roddick was furious with himself for failing to take advantage of leads in both tie-breaks. ""i'm usually pretty money in those,"" said roddick. ""either one of those would have given me a distinct advantage. ""i'm mad, i felt i was in there with a shot. he put himself in position to win big points. i donated a little more than i would have wanted."" and the american played down the influence of one spectator who appeared to contribute to a double fault by shouting during rodick's service action.

"$1m payoff for former shell boss  shell is to pay $1m (£522,000) to the ex-finance chief who stepped down from her post in april 2004 after the firm over-stated its reserves.  judy boynton finally left the firm on 31 december, having spent the intervening time as a special advisor to chief executive jeroen van der veer. in january 2004, shell told shocked investors that its reserves were 20% smaller than previously thought. shell said the pay-off was in line with ms boynton's contract. she was leaving ""by mutual agreement to pursue other career opportunities"", the firm said in a statement. the severance package means she keeps long-term share options, but fails to collect on a 2003 incentive plan since the firm has failed to meet the targets included in it.  the revelation that shell had inflated its reserves led to the resignation of its chairman, sir phil watts, and production chief walter van der vijver.  an investigation commissioned by shell found that ms boynton had to share responsibility for the company's behaviour. despite receiving an email from mr van de vijver which said the firm had ""fooled"" the market about its reserves, the investigation said, she did nothing to inquire further. in all, shell restated its reserves four times during 2003. in september, it paid £82.7m in fines to regulators on both sides of the atlantic for violating market rules in its reporting of its reserves.","shell is to pay $1m (£522,000) to the ex-finance chief who stepped down from her post in april 2004 after the firm over-stated its reserves.despite receiving an email from mr van de vijver which said the firm had ""fooled"" the market about its reserves, the investigation said, she did nothing to inquire further.shell said the pay-off was in line with ms boynton's contract.in all, shell restated its reserves four times during 2003.the revelation that shell had inflated its reserves led to the resignation of its chairman, sir phil watts, and production chief walter van der vijver."
"souped-up wi-fi is on the horizon  super high-speed wireless data networks could soon be in use in the uk.  the government's wireless watchdog is seeking help on the best way to regulate the technology behind such networks called ultra wideband (uwb). ofcom wants to ensure that the arrival of uwb-using devices does not cause problems for those that already use the same part of the radio spectrum. uwb makes it possible to stream huge amounts of data through the air over short distances. one of the more likely uses of uwb is to make it possible to send dvd quality video images wirelessly to tv screens or to let people beam music to media players around their home. the technology has the potential to transmit hundreds of megabits of data per second. uwb could also be used to create so-called personal area networks that let a person's gadgets quickly and easily swap data amongst themselves. the technology works over a range up to 10 metres and uses billions of short radio pulses every second to carry data. at the recent consumer electronics show in las vegas products with uwb chips built-in got their first public airing.  currently, use of uwb is only allowed in the uk under a strict licencing scheme. ""we're seeking opinion from industry to find out whether or not we should allow uwb on a licence-exempt basis,"" said a spokesman for ofcom.  companies have until 24 march to respond. in april the ec is due to start its own consultation on europe-wide adoption of uwb. the cross-europe body for radio regulators, known as the european conference of postal and telecommunications administrations (cept), is carrying out research for this harmonisation programme. early sight of the cept work has caused controversy as some think it over-emphasises uwb's potential to interfere with existing users. by contrast a preliminary ofcom report found that it would be quite straight-forward to deploy uwb without causing problems for those that already use it. the ofcom spokesman said it was considering imposing a ""mask"" or set of technical restrictions on uwb-using devices. ""we would want these devices to have very strict controls on power levels so they can not transmit a long way or over a wide area,"" he said. despite the current restrictions the technology is already being used. cambridge-based ubisense has about 40 customers around the world using the short-range radio technology, said david theriault, standards and regulatory liaison for ubisense. he said that uwb was driving novel ways to interact with computers. ""it's like having a 3d mouse all the time,"" he said. he said that european decisions on what to do with uwb allied with ieee decisions on the exact specifications for it would help drive adoption. prior to its adoption as a way for gadgets and computers to communicate, uwb was used as a sensing technology. it is used to spot such things as cracks under the surface of runways or to help firemen detect people through walls.","prior to its adoption as a way for gadgets and computers to communicate, uwb was used as a sensing technology.he said that uwb was driving novel ways to interact with computers.he said that european decisions on what to do with uwb allied with ieee decisions on the exact specifications for it would help drive adoption.the government's wireless watchdog is seeking help on the best way to regulate the technology behind such networks called ultra wideband (uwb).""we're seeking opinion from industry to find out whether or not we should allow uwb on a licence-exempt basis,"" said a spokesman for ofcom.by contrast a preliminary ofcom report found that it would be quite straight-forward to deploy uwb without causing problems for those that already use it.uwb could also be used to create so-called personal area networks that let a person's gadgets quickly and easily swap data amongst themselves.currently, use of uwb is only allowed in the uk under a strict licencing scheme.uwb makes it possible to stream huge amounts of data through the air over short distances.the technology has the potential to transmit hundreds of megabits of data per second."
"wmc profits up amid bid criticism  australian mining firm wmc resources has seen a fivefold rise in profits while continuing to be the target of a hostile takeover bid.  wmc said it made net profits of 1.33bn australian dollars ($1bn; £550m) in 2004, up from a$246bn the year before. it is currently arguing against an offer from swiss xstrata, which the firm raised to a$8.4bn last week after wmc said it was an undervaluation. now reports say that the australian government is against the deal.  trade minister mark vaile has said that the bid may be ""against the national interest"". mr vaile, who was quoted in the australian financial review, compared xstrata's attempt to take over wmc to a similar bid by oil giant shell for australia's woodside petroleum in 2001. the bid was thrown out by treasurer peter costello on national interest grounds. wmc's interests in uranium deposits were a contributing factor, mr vaile said. wmc itself, however, has no objection in principle to being bought out, having spun off its aluminium operations in 2002 to make itself a more tempting target - as long as the price is right. its stellar performance in 2004 has been built on sky-high prices for metals. copper and nickel in particular have been in high demand thanks to china's booming economy, which expanded more than 9% in each of the past two years. nickel prices rose 43% during the year, with copper up 36%.","trade minister mark vaile has said that the bid may be ""against the national interest"".australian mining firm wmc resources has seen a fivefold rise in profits while continuing to be the target of a hostile takeover bid.wmc said it made net profits of 1.33bn australian dollars ($1bn; £550m) in 2004, up from a$246bn the year before.mr vaile, who was quoted in the australian financial review, compared xstrata's attempt to take over wmc to a similar bid by oil giant shell for australia's woodside petroleum in 2001.wmc itself, however, has no objection in principle to being bought out, having spun off its aluminium operations in 2002 to make itself a more tempting target - as long as the price is right."

"millions to miss out on the net  by 2025, 40% of the uk's population will still be without internet access at home, says a study.  around 23 million britons will miss out on a wide range of essential services such as education and medical information, predicts the report by telecoms giant bt. it compares to 27 million, or 50%, of the uk, who are not currently online. the idea that the digital divide will evaporate with time is ""wishful thinking"", the report concludes.  the study calls on the government and telecoms industry to come up with new ways to lure those that have been bypassed by the digital revolution. although the percentage of britons without home access will have fallen slightly, those that remain digital refuseniks will miss out on more, the report suggests. as more and more everyday tasks move online and offline services become less comprehensive, the divide will become more obvious and more burdensome for those that have not got net access, it predicts.  the gap between ""have-nets"" and ""have-nots"" has been much talked about, but predictions about how such a divide will affect future generations has been less discussed. bt set out to predict future patterns based on current information and taking account of the way technology is changing. optimists who predict that convergence and the emergence of more user-friendly technology will bridge the digital divide could be way off mark, the report suggests. ""internet access on other devices tends to be something taken up by those who already have it,"" said adrian hosford, director of corporate responsibility at bt. costs of internet access have fallen dramatically and coverage in remote areas have vastly improved over the last year but the real barrier remains psychological. ""there is a hard rump of have-nots who are not engaging with the net. they don't have the motivation or skills or perceive the benefits,"" said mr hosford.  as now, the most disadvantaged groups are likely to remain among low income families, the older generation and the disabled.  those on low incomes will account for a quarter of the digital have-nots, the disabled will make up 16% and the elderly nearly a third by 2025, the report forecasts. organisations such as bt have a responsibility to help tackle the problem, said mr hosford. the telco has seen positive results with its everybody online project which offers internet access to people in eight deprived communities around britain. in one area of cornwall with high levels of unemployment, online training helped people rewrite cvs and learn skills to get new jobs, explained mr hosford. such grassroot activity addressing the specific needs of individual communities is essential is the problem of the digital divide is to be overcome, he said. ""if we don't address this problem now, it will get a lot worse and people will find it more difficult to find jobs, education opportunities will be limited and they'll simply not be able to keep up with society,"" he said. the alliance for digital inclusion, an independent body with members drawn from government, industry and the voluntary sector has recently been set up to tackle some of the issues faced by the digital refuseniks.","although the percentage of britons without home access will have fallen slightly, those that remain digital refuseniks will miss out on more, the report suggests.""internet access on other devices tends to be something taken up by those who already have it,"" said adrian hosford, director of corporate responsibility at bt.optimists who predict that convergence and the emergence of more user-friendly technology will bridge the digital divide could be way off mark, the report suggests.organisations such as bt have a responsibility to help tackle the problem, said mr hosford.such grassroot activity addressing the specific needs of individual communities is essential is the problem of the digital divide is to be overcome, he said.the idea that the digital divide will evaporate with time is ""wishful thinking"", the report concludes.those on low incomes will account for a quarter of the digital have-nots, the disabled will make up 16% and the elderly nearly a third by 2025, the report forecasts.as more and more everyday tasks move online and offline services become less comprehensive, the divide will become more obvious and more burdensome for those that have not got net access, it predicts.the telco has seen positive results with its everybody online project which offers internet access to people in eight deprived communities around britain."
"steady job growth continues in us  the us created fewer jobs than expected in december, but analysts said that the dip in hiring was not enough to derail the world's biggest economy.  according to labor department figures, 157,000 new jobs were added last month. that took 2004's total to 2.2 million, the best showing in five years. job creation was one of last year's main concerns for the us economy. while worries still remain, the conditions are set for steady growth in 2005, analysts said. the unemployment rate stayed at 5.4% in december, and about 200,000 jobs will need to be created each month if that figure is to drop.  ""it was a respectable report,"" said michael moran, analyst at daiwa securities.  ""payroll growth in december was a little lighter than the consensus forecast, but we had upward revisions to the prior two months and an increase in manufacturing employment."" ""manufacturing is a cyclical area of the economy and if it's showing job growth, it's a good indication that the economy is on a solid growth track."" that means that the federal reserve is likely to continue its policy of raising interest rates. the fed lifted borrowing costs five times last year to 2.25%, citing evidence the us economic recovery was becoming more robust.  job creation was one of last year's main concerns for the us economy, and proved to be a main topic of debate in the us presidential election. while demand for workers is far from booming, the conditions are set for steady growth. ""overall, compared to the previous year it looks great, it just keeps going stronger and stronger and i expect that to be the case"" in 2005, said kurt karl, economist at swiss re in new york. meanwhile, economists cautioned against reading too much into data from the federal reserve showing an unexpected $8.7bn drop in consumer debt in november. a fall in consumer spending, which makes up about two-thirds of all us economic activity, could help limit the extent of any future interest rate rises. but economists said there could be a number of reasons for a fall in the borrowing, which include credit cards and personal loans, while noting that such figures can vary on a month-to-month basis.","job creation was one of last year's main concerns for the us economy.job creation was one of last year's main concerns for the us economy, and proved to be a main topic of debate in the us presidential election.the us created fewer jobs than expected in december, but analysts said that the dip in hiring was not enough to derail the world's biggest economy.""manufacturing is a cyclical area of the economy and if it's showing job growth, it's a good indication that the economy is on a solid growth track.""while worries still remain, the conditions are set for steady growth in 2005, analysts said.the fed lifted borrowing costs five times last year to 2.25%, citing evidence the us economic recovery was becoming more robust.the unemployment rate stayed at 5.4% in december, and about 200,000 jobs will need to be created each month if that figure is to drop."

"dvd review: spider-man 2  it's a universal rule that a film can either be a superhero special effects extravaganza or it can be good. but spider-man 2 breaks that rule in two.  it's not fantastically deep but you get quickly drawn into the tale of spidey versus doc ock and more so into the fate of poor peter parker. gigantic action set pieces seamlessly work with more brooding personal torment and it all looks stunning. a few effects look false but tobey maguire, kirsten dunst and alfred molina make this compelling. the other universal rule is that dvds of superhero films will have making of features only about the effects. this disc covers those special effects enough but as just one part of a detailed look at the film. then there are commentaries, trailers and a blooper reel.  sometimes quality comes in bulk: this set contains no less than 34 john wayne films ranging from the westerns and war movies to the quiet man.  now is that a christmas present or what? give this to someone on 24 december and you won't see them again until early in the new year. it's not truly a complete collection and leans more toward wayne's earlier films: there's no true grit, for instance, though there is hellraisers. the films look well transferred to dvd, though none has extras.  it was very daft but it knew it was and somehow this famous 1979 series became a cult favourite that's been long awaited on dvd. this set has the first season of buck (gil gerard) and wilma's (erin gray) tongue-in-cheek adventures and it's all as camp and gaudy as you remember. but it's also a disappointment. the us dvd has this and the more po-faced second season - and you can import it for just about the same price. the bigger omission, though, is that there are no extras. that's particularly disappointing because originally there were meant to be commentaries and stars gerard and gray had agreed to do them.","the films look well transferred to dvd, though none has extras.it's a universal rule that a film can either be a superhero special effects extravaganza or it can be good.this disc covers those special effects enough but as just one part of a detailed look at the film.the other universal rule is that dvds of superhero films will have making of features only about the effects.this set has the first season of buck (gil gerard) and wilma's (erin gray) tongue-in-cheek adventures and it's all as camp and gaudy as you remember.the us dvd has this and the more po-faced second season - and you can import it for just about the same price.the bigger omission, though, is that there are no extras.sometimes quality comes in bulk: this set contains no less than 34 john wayne films ranging from the westerns and war movies to the quiet man."

"bargain calls widen softbank loss  japanese communications firm softbank has widened losses after heavy spending on a new cut-rate phone service.  the service, launched in december and dubbed ""otoku"" or ""bargain"", has had almost 900,000 orders, softbank said. the firm, a market leader in high-speed internet, had an operating loss for the three months to december of 7.5bn yen ($71.5m; £38.4m). but without the otoku marketing spend it would have made a profit - and expects to move into the black in 2006. the firm did not give a figure for the extent of profits it expected to make next year. it was born in the 1990s tech boom, investing widely and becoming a fast-rising star, till the end of the tech bubble hit it hard. its recent return to a high profile came with the purchase of japan telecom, the country's third-biggest fixed-line telecoms firm. the acquisition spurred its broadband internet division to pole position in the japanese market, with more than 5.1 million subscribers at the end of december.","the firm, a market leader in high-speed internet, had an operating loss for the three months to december of 7.5bn yen ($71.5m; £38.4m).japanese communications firm softbank has widened losses after heavy spending on a new cut-rate phone service.the service, launched in december and dubbed ""otoku"" or ""bargain"", has had almost 900,000 orders, softbank said.the acquisition spurred its broadband internet division to pole position in the japanese market, with more than 5.1 million subscribers at the end of december."
"japan's ageing workforce: built to last  in his twenties he battled tuberculosis for eight years, then went on to run his own clothing business before marrying in his late thirties. and the 101-year-old torao toshitsune has eaten raw fish pretty much every day throughout his life.  mr toshitsune is one of japan's 23,000 centenarians - a club that is growing by 13% annually, and where the oldest member is 114. at his neat osaka detached house, where he lives with one of his sexagenarian daughters, mr toshitsune keeps a regular routine of copying out buddhist sutras and preparing the traditional japanese tea ceremony. between tasks, this remarkably active senior citizen reveals what his next goal is: ""well, what's most important for me is to be japan's number one."" mr toshitsune wants to outlive everyone. and when it comes to longevity, japan, as a country, appears to be doing just that. women can expect to live until 85, men until 78, four years longer than americans and europeans.  on the outskirts of kyoto, 83-year-old yuji shimizu contemplates this phenomenon during a round of golf with his younger friends, who are in their seventies.  ""i think this is because the food industry and the environment have improved,"" he remarks. ""on average, we can live longer."" whether it's the diet, or the traditional family structure where roles were clearly defined, or just something in the genes, japan's elderly are remarkable. but while life may be a game of golf for mr shimizu, his grandchildren have huge problems ahead. japan is the world's least fertile nation with childbirth rates of just two thirds of that in the us.  by 2007, japan's population is expected to peak at 127 million, then shrink to under 100 million by the middle of the century. this means 30 million fewer workers at a time when the number of elderly will have almost doubled.  ""in the year 2050, if the birth rate remains the same people over 60 will make up over 30% of the population,"" explains shigeo morioka of the international longevity centre in tokyo. so how will japan's finances stay on track? after a decade of economic stagnation and huge deficit spending, the public sector debt is already about 140% of the country's gross domestic product (gdp), the highest rate among industrialised countries. the international monetary fund predicts that as the falling birth rate takes grip from 2010, the cost of running japan's welfare state will double to more than 5% of gdp, while current account balances will deteriorate by over 2%. but unfortunately, japan appears poorly prepared both financially and politically. glen wood, vice president of deutsche securities japan, asks; ""who's going to fund the pension fund for the next generation and indeed who are going to be the new japanese worker? ""who is going to build the economy, who are going to be the leaders? who are going to be the producers of the gdp going forward?"" one option is further welfare reform. another is immigration, possibly from the philippines and indonesia. but so far, any emerging policy appears restricted to a limited number of nursing staff.  standing next to tokyo harbour is a version of new york's statue of liberty. but, as yet, japan is not ready for an ellis island.  ""japan has never really liked that option in its history and i think it's an option that's becoming more and more plausible and necessary,"" insists mr wood. in japan, as in europe which also faces a workforce decline, immigration is a very sensitive subject. but for the japanese economy, facing 8% fewer consumers by 2050 means slumping domestic sales of cars, hi-tech kit and home appliances, perhaps even another property crash.  of course the japanese could always have more children. the government is currently considering financial rewards for procreative couples similar to those in operation in australia. but there would be no pay back until 2030, when today's babies are taxpayers, and the demographic crisis, like in europe, starts to unfold in 2010. in contrast to japan - and of course the european union - the us population is expected to increase by 46% to 420 million by the middle of the century. although president bush must re-devise social security to take account of a 130% rise in america's over 65s, the imf foresees a positive contribution to the us current account balance from the combined forces of fertility and immigration.  some voices in japanese industry are calling for radical changes to the nature of the japanese labour market. they want a shift towards financial services, though doubts persist over the country's ability, let alone willingness, to move away from manufacturing. ""japan still has problems getting a viable banking system, let alone shifting their auto business or their semi-conductor business or the broad based tech manufacturing business overseas,"" says mr wood. japan can either drive some radical reforms or else run the risk of a vicious ageing recession. falling demand and a lower tax take could result in soaring budget pressures and a basket case currency. come 2020, japan could be more dependent on a shrinking workforce than any other industrialised power. there are fears that the world's number two economy is doomed to a permanent recession. but none of this is mr toshitsune's concern anymore. at 101, he chuckles that, he feels fine.","glen wood, vice president of deutsche securities japan, asks; ""who's going to fund the pension fund for the next generation and indeed who are going to be the new japanese worker?and when it comes to longevity, japan, as a country, appears to be doing just that.in contrast to japan - and of course the european union - the us population is expected to increase by 46% to 420 million by the middle of the century.""japan has never really liked that option in its history and i think it's an option that's becoming more and more plausible and necessary,"" insists mr wood.mr toshitsune is one of japan's 23,000 centenarians - a club that is growing by 13% annually, and where the oldest member is 114.come 2020, japan could be more dependent on a shrinking workforce than any other industrialised power.""japan still has problems getting a viable banking system, let alone shifting their auto business or their semi-conductor business or the broad based tech manufacturing business overseas,"" says mr wood.in japan, as in europe which also faces a workforce decline, immigration is a very sensitive subject.japan is the world's least fertile nation with childbirth rates of just two thirds of that in the us.at his neat osaka detached house, where he lives with one of his sexagenarian daughters, mr toshitsune keeps a regular routine of copying out buddhist sutras and preparing the traditional japanese tea ceremony.the international monetary fund predicts that as the falling birth rate takes grip from 2010, the cost of running japan's welfare state will double to more than 5% of gdp, while current account balances will deteriorate by over 2%.but unfortunately, japan appears poorly prepared both financially and politically.japan can either drive some radical reforms or else run the risk of a vicious ageing recession.mr toshitsune wants to outlive everyone.by 2007, japan's population is expected to peak at 127 million, then shrink to under 100 million by the middle of the century.but, as yet, japan is not ready for an ellis island.but while life may be a game of golf for mr shimizu, his grandchildren have huge problems ahead.between tasks, this remarkably active senior citizen reveals what his next goal is: ""well, what's most important for me is to be japan's number one.""""who is going to build the economy, who are going to be the leaders?"
"labour mps' fears over squabbling  if there is one thing certain to stiffen the spines of labour mps it is the prospect of losing their seats at a general election.  and it was largely that fear that led to tony blair and gordon brown being read the riot act during a meeting of the parliamentary labour party. the views expressed by both backbenchers and labour peers over the claimed squabbling between the two men starkly demonstrated the widely-held view within the labour party that the two most powerful figures in the government are jeopardising the next election. as one hugely-disgruntled backbencher said before the meeting: ""it is time they realised it's not just my seat they are threatening but if they go on like this they could put the election in doubt."" it is a sentiment that is now running throughout the labour benches with mps eager to underline the message to their leaders to stop the squabbling and get on with the job at hand.  as paul flynn said: ""what has deeply upset the party is in this time of all times, when we wanted to come together, we wanted to lead on the global issues, to change politics for the next decade, the whole thing was wrecked by a piece of childishness by the two main people in the party, two people we greatly respect.""  stephen pound echoed the message, saying: ""we know that the one thing that could entirely jeopardise what we are trying to achieve, not for the labour party but for this country, is the appearance of division. we remember the 1980s"". they backed the suggestion that unless the squabbling stopped, the people briefing on behalf of the two men would be ""named and shamed"". the dressing down appears to have done the trick, with mr brown joining his alleged rival alan milburn - who the prime minister put in charge of election planning in mr brown's stead - and deputy prime minister john prescott at an election poster launch. but the effect of all this is to have achieved two things. firstly, nobody is attempting to suggest any more that the stories of the rift between the chancellor and the prime minister are fictions created by the media and authors. even mr prescott admitted that, had he still been a backbencher, he would have been giving mr blair and mr brown the same message.  secondly it has also underlined the view that the election campaign has, to all intents and purposes, kicked off. but whether the telling off and the subsequent change in behaviour by the two men will do any good - or can even be sustained through the campaign - remains to be seen.  even as the mps were expressing their fears it emerged that, while mr brown is in africa for a week, the prime minister is to deliver a keynote speech on election themes for a third term. and he is expected to repeat his recent insistence that the next manifesto will be ""new"" labour through and through. similarly, some were pointing out that the chancellor, during the election poster launch, once again refused to deny the claim that he told the prime minister he could never trust anything he said. none the less, what some believe now is that the effect of the warnings from the backbenchers will actually be to silence the brown camp, effectively strengthening the prime minister's hand. for example, will those brownite briefers suggest their man is unhappy at the prime minister's timing or subject matter, as may have been the case in the past? what all seem agreed on, however, is that this sniping simply cannot be allowed to go on through the election campaign. mind you, we have heard similar pledges before.","the views expressed by both backbenchers and labour peers over the claimed squabbling between the two men starkly demonstrated the widely-held view within the labour party that the two most powerful figures in the government are jeopardising the next election.the dressing down appears to have done the trick, with mr brown joining his alleged rival alan milburn - who the prime minister put in charge of election planning in mr brown's stead - and deputy prime minister john prescott at an election poster launch.even as the mps were expressing their fears it emerged that, while mr brown is in africa for a week, the prime minister is to deliver a keynote speech on election themes for a third term.if there is one thing certain to stiffen the spines of labour mps it is the prospect of losing their seats at a general election.similarly, some were pointing out that the chancellor, during the election poster launch, once again refused to deny the claim that he told the prime minister he could never trust anything he said.as one hugely-disgruntled backbencher said before the meeting: ""it is time they realised it's not just my seat they are threatening but if they go on like this they could put the election in doubt.""as paul flynn said: ""what has deeply upset the party is in this time of all times, when we wanted to come together, we wanted to lead on the global issues, to change politics for the next decade, the whole thing was wrecked by a piece of childishness by the two main people in the party, two people we greatly respect.""even mr prescott admitted that, had he still been a backbencher, he would have been giving mr blair and mr brown the same message.none the less, what some believe now is that the effect of the warnings from the backbenchers will actually be to silence the brown camp, effectively strengthening the prime minister's hand."

"brando 'rejected godfather role'  late film star marlon brando is said to have repeatedly turned down his oscar-winning role in the godfather.  the actor's friend budd schulberg told vanity fair magazine that brando's assistant suggested he read the novel. the actor repeatedly refused, throwing the book at her and saying: ""for the last time, i won't glorify the mafia"". but brando, who died last july at the age of 80, eventually took the role of don corleone, winning him an oscar in 1973 which he notoriously refused. the actor sent a young woman dressed in native american costume to refuse the award on his behalf and to draw attention to the plight of native americans.  schulberg told the magazine that brando's assistant realised the film star had warmed to the idea of the godfather role when he sported a drawn-on pencil moustache and asked: ""how do i look?"" his assistant, alice marchak, said that he looked like george raft, an actor famed for playing gangsters on the silver screen. every time she went to see brando from then on, she added, he was wearing a different gangster-style moustache. brando was asked to screen test for the role in the godfather, as studio executives were said to be reluctant for the actor to play the part following problems on the set of brando's previous film mutiny on the bounty . in fact brando's academy award triumph revived his career. the actor was nominated for an oscar the following year for his role in bernardo bertolucci's last tango in paris. before his death, brando granted gaming company electronic arts the rights to use his voice and image in a video game based on the godfather film and book and recorded voice-overs which closely resembled his role as don corleone. brando's co-stars from the godfather, james caan and robert duvall, will also reprise their roles for the video game, it was confirmed on wednesday.","brando was asked to screen test for the role in the godfather, as studio executives were said to be reluctant for the actor to play the part following problems on the set of brando's previous film mutiny on the bounty .schulberg told the magazine that brando's assistant realised the film star had warmed to the idea of the godfather role when he sported a drawn-on pencil moustache and asked: ""how do i look?""late film star marlon brando is said to have repeatedly turned down his oscar-winning role in the godfather.the actor was nominated for an oscar the following year for his role in bernardo bertolucci's last tango in paris.brando's co-stars from the godfather, james caan and robert duvall, will also reprise their roles for the video game, it was confirmed on wednesday.before his death, brando granted gaming company electronic arts the rights to use his voice and image in a video game based on the godfather film and book and recorded voice-overs which closely resembled his role as don corleone."

"digital guru floats sub-$100 pc  nicholas negroponte, chairman and founder of mit's media labs, says he is developing a laptop pc that will go on sale for less than $100 (£53).  he told the bbc world service programme go digital he hoped it would become an education tool in developing countries. he said one laptop per child could be "" very important to the development of not just that child but now the whole family, village and neighbourhood"". he said the child could use the laptop like a text book. he described the device as a stripped down laptop, which would run a linux-based operating system, ""we have to get the display down to below $20, to do this we need to rear project the image rather than using an ordinary flat panel.  ""the second trick is to get rid of the fat , if you can skinny it down you can gain speed and the ability to use smaller processors and slower memory."" the device will probably be exported as a kit of parts to be assembled locally to keep costs down. mr negroponte said this was a not for profit venture, though he recognised that the manufacturers of the components would be making money. in 1995 mr negroponte published the bestselling being digital, now widely seen as predicting the digital age. the concept is based on experiments in the us state of maine, where children were given laptop computers to take home and do their work on.  while the idea was popular amongst the children, it initially received some resistance from the teachers and there were problems with laptops getting broken. however, mr negroponte has adapted the idea to his own work in cambodia where he set up two schools together with his wife and gave the children laptops. ""we put in 25 laptops three years ago , only one has been broken, the kids cherish these things, it's also a tv a telephone and a games machine, not just a textbook."" mr negroponte wants the laptops to become more common than mobile phones but conceded this was ambitious.

"brazil approves bankruptcy reform  a major reform of brazil's bankruptcy laws has been approved by the country's congress, in a move which it is hoped will cut the cost of borrowing.  the bill, proposed in 1993, has finally been approved by the leadership of president luiz inacio lula da silva. the old law, dating from 1945, gave priority first to workers, second to tax revenue and finally to creditors. the new legislation changes this, giving priority to creditors and limiting payments to workers. the new regulations will limit payments to workers to 150 times the minimum monthly salary, which is currently $94. the law also makes it more difficult for a company to declare bankruptcy. however, when a firm is declared bankrupt it will gain protection from creditors for 180 days while a recovery plan is worked out.  the proposals were opposed in the past by leftist parties, including mr lula's worker party. they considered that they undermined workers' rights. but president lula became a defender of the reforms, arguing that the country's bank lending margins were among the highest in the world and were damaging the economy. according to andreas adriano of latin trade magazine, the new bankruptcy law will help in reducing the spread - difference between the interest rates of the banks and federal bonds. nevertheless, mr adriano said to reduce the basic interest rate the central bank needs to change its policy, focusing not only on inflation but also on economic growth.","the new legislation changes this, giving priority to creditors and limiting payments to workers.according to andreas adriano of latin trade magazine, the new bankruptcy law will help in reducing the spread - difference between the interest rates of the banks and federal bonds.the old law, dating from 1945, gave priority first to workers, second to tax revenue and finally to creditors.a major reform of brazil's bankruptcy laws has been approved by the country's congress, in a move which it is hoped will cut the cost of borrowing.the law also makes it more difficult for a company to declare bankruptcy."
"games 'deserve a place in class'  computer games could enhance learning and have a legitimate place in the classroom, say researchers.  academics from the institute of education at london university found that ""games literacy"" was a key skill for youngsters. as well as being used in different areas of the curriculum, games are a legitimate area of study in their own right, researchers say. pupils should also be able to create their own games, they say.  ""like all games, computer and video games entertain while promoting social development, and playing and talking about games is an important part of young people's lives,"" said project manager caroline pelletier.  ""games literacy is a way of investigating how games are means of expression and representation, just like writing or drawing,"" she said. the researchers conducted two studies into the impact of games on education, the first looking at how they can be used in different curriculum subjects to enhance learning. researchers found that girls were often excluded from the male-dominated world of game playing. ""without first-hand experience of how much fun a game can be, they have little motivation to play and remain disengaged from an engrossing and sociable activity,"" said research fellow diane carr.  the second project looked at how games can be integrated into media education and concluded that writing games should be a core part of studying them. sixth-form teacher barney oram already teaches computer games alongside the more traditional study of film, tv and popular music at the a-level course he runs at long road sixth form college in cambridge.  for parents, the idea that computer games could be brought into the classroom environment, could cause controversy. dr andrew burn, associate director of the institute of education's centre for the study of children, youth and media moved to reassure anxious parents. ""games are a legitimate cultural form that deserve critical analysis in schools just as film, television and literature do,"" he said. ""but we also want to argue that full understanding only comes when children have the tools to create their own games."" the games industry welcomed the report, saying it showed how games had a positive impact on children. ""at a time of hysterical and inaccurate reporting it is heartening to see the cultural, social and educational value of computer and video games being assessed intelligently,"" said roger bennett, director general of the entertainment and leisure software publishers association.

"web photo storage market hots up  an increasing number of firms are offering web storage for people with digital photo collections.  digital cameras were the hot gadget of christmas 2004 and worldwide sales of the cameras totalled $24bn last year. many people's hard drives are bulging with photos and services which allow them to store and share their pictures online are becoming popular. search firms such as google are also offering more complex tools for managing personal photo libraries. photo giants such as kodak offer website storage which manages photo collections, lets users edit pictures online and provides print-ordering services. some services, such as kodak's ofoto and snapfish, offer unlimited storage space but they do require users to buy some prints online. other sites, such as pixagogo, charge a monthly fee. marcus hawkins, editor of digital camera magazine, said: ""as file sizes of pictures increase, storage becomes a problem. ""people are using their hard drives, backing up on cd and dvd and now they are using online storage solutions.  ""they are a place to store pictures, to share their pictures with families and friends and they can print out their photos.""  while many of the services are aimed at the amateur and casual digital photographer, other websites are geared up for enthusiasts who want to share tips and information. photosig is an online community of photographers who can critique each other's work. on tuesday, google released free software for organising and finding digital photos stored on a computer's hard drive. the tool, called picasa, automatically detects photos as they are added to a pc - whether sent via e-mail or transferred from a digital camera.  the software includes tools for restoring colour and removing red eye, as well as sharpening images. photos can then be uploaded to sites such as ofoto. many people use the sites to edit and improve their favourite photographs before ordering prints. mr hawkins added: ""the growth area is that you can order your prints online. friends and family can also access pictures you want them to see and they can print them out too. ""rather than just a place to dump your pictures, it's about sharing them.""  the vast majority of pictures remain on a pc's hard drive, which is why search tools, such as those offered by google, become increasingly important. but some historians and archivists are concerned that the need for perfect pictures will mean that those poor quality prints which offered a tantilising glimpse of the past may disappear forever.

""the results show that people can learn to use scalp-recorded electroencephalogram rhythms to control rapid and accurate movement of a cursor in two directions,"" said jonathan wolpaw and dennis mcfarlane. the research team, from new york state department of health and state university of new york in albany, said the research was another step towards people controlling wheelchairs or other electronic devices by thought.  the four people faced a large video screen wearing a special cap which, meant no surgery or implantation was needed.  brain activity produces electrical signals that can be read by electrodes. complex algorithms then translate those signals into instructions to direct the computer. such brain activity does not require the use of any nerves of muscles, so people with stroke or spinal cord injuries could use the cap effectively. ""the impressive non-invasive multidimensional control achieved in the present study suggests that a non-invasive brain control interface could support clinically useful operation of a robotic arm, a motorised wheelchair or a neuroprosthesis,"" said the researchers. the four volunteers also showed that they could get better at controlling the cursor the more times they tried. although the two partially-paralysed people performed better overall, the researchers said this could be because their brains were more used to adapting or that they were simply more motivated. it is not the first time researchers have had this sort of success in brain-control experiments. some teams have used eye motion and other recording techniques. earlier this year, a team at the mit media labs europe demonstrated a wireless cap which read brain waves to control a computer character.","although the two partially-paralysed people performed better overall, the researchers said this could be because their brains were more used to adapting or that they were simply more motivated.a team of us researchers has shown that controlling devices with the brain is a step closer.earlier this year, a team at the mit media labs europe demonstrated a wireless cap which read brain waves to control a computer character.four people, two of them partly paralysed wheelchair users, successfully moved a computer cursor while wearing a cap with 64 electrodes.previous research has shown that monkeys can control a computer with electrodes implanted into their brain.the research team, from new york state department of health and state university of new york in albany, said the research was another step towards people controlling wheelchairs or other electronic devices by thought.such brain activity does not require the use of any nerves of muscles, so people with stroke or spinal cord injuries could use the cap effectively."

"new foot and mouth action urged  a senior tory mp has criticised agriculture department defra's ""lackadaisical"" approach to planning for a future foot and mouth outbreak.  public accounts committee chairman edward leigh was giving his reaction to a report by a government watchdog on lessons to be learnt from the crisis. the national audit office said defra had improved its capacity to deal with future livestock disease outbreaks. but mr leigh said the department was ""dragging its heels"".  that comment referred to the setting up of a scheme to share any future compensation costs with industry. he also said defra had been ""dreadfully slow"" in paying some of its bills dating from the foot and mouth crisis.  the outbreak, which began in 2001, led to the slaughter of 6.5 million animals, devastated many farms and rural businesses, and is estimated to have cost the uk up to £8bn. ""four years after the outbreak, defra is yet to begin its planned review of some of its contractors' costs, and £40m of invoices remain unpaid,"" mr leigh said. mr leigh also pointed out that the introduction of an it system to help control future outbreaks had been delayed. in november it emerged european commission compensation amounted to just over a third of the money the uk government had hoped to get as reimbursement for the billions lost through the foot and mouth crisis.  ministers had hoped to get £900m from the european union vet fund to help with animal slaughter and other costs but in the end was granted £349m. that was because the uk had valued the culled animals at between ""two and three times"" the commission's assessment of their likely market value. national audit office chief sir john bourn said a new compensation scheme was now being looked at. on the issue of the unpaid invoices, sir john said defra had paid 97% of the £1.3bn submitted by contractors since 2001, ""but has not agreed a final settlement with 57 contractors pending the results of its investigations"".  mr leigh said being ""better prepared"" would also help avoid the need for ""mass funeral pyres which provided an unsettling images of the 2001 outbreak"". a defra spokesman said: ""we welcome the report. it acknowledges the progress the department has made since 2001 - particularly on contingency planning and our improved capacity and preparedness for combating another major disease outbreak.

"could yukos be a blessing in disguise?  other things being equal, the notion of entrepreneurs languishing in jail while their companies are sold off for a song ought to be bad for business.  but in the looking-glass world of modern russia, the opposite might just be true, a new report* has argued. the study, from the centre for economic policy research, does not praise the rough handling of oil company yukos. but it argues that more rigorous tax policing has benefited all russian firms, even targets of the tax police. ""an increase in tax enforcement can increase the amount [of dividends and other income] outside shareholders will receive, even accounting for increased levels of taxation,"" the authors say.  the paper's reasoning is complex, and is based on a sophisticated model of the relationship between tax regimes and corporate governance - in particular, the propensity of management to steal from the company. the calculations demonstrated what many russian analysts already knew: that increasing the tax rate increases the amount that managers steal, since undeclared income becomes relatively more valuable. in the west, meanwhile, higher tax rates translate far more smoothly into higher government revenues. on the other hand, increasing the rigour with which taxes are collected encourages companies to become more transparent, forcing them to be able to demonstrate their financial position far more accurately. the net result, the authors say, is that the extra amount companies pay in tax is more than compensated for by greater efficiency and financial soundness.  after vladimir putin became president in 2000, he did not raise taxes, but put a lot of effort - too much, critics argue - into enforcement.  since then, the russian stock market has more than trebled in value, a rise the authors attribute at least in part to the newly tough approach. the report highlights the case of sibneft, a russian oil company that came close to merging with yukos last year. after mr putin came to power, the company's overall effective tax rate rose from 2.6% to 10.4%, and sibneft was the target of a series of aggressive raids by fiscal police. but shareholders benefited hugely: sibneft started to pay dividends - $53m in 2000 and almost $1bn in 2001 - and closed down the network of opaque subsidiaries it had previously used for siphoning off unofficial funds. according to the authors, although a variety of changes were sweeping through russian industry at the time, the increase in tax enforcement is the only likely explanation for the change of fortunes at sibneft and many of its peers.  does this analysis make sense? in part, certainly. for all its faults, corporate russia has become far more orderly and law-abiding since 2000. companies have rushed to list their shares on international stock exchanges - something unthinkable in the wilder days of the 1990s - and most large firms now produce their accounts to international standards. foreign direct investment, long negligible, is starting to flow in serious amounts - $7bn in 2003 - and stock market returns have been among the healthiest in europe. but the authors' model does not quite cover all the complexities. for a start, the model assumes that the various parties have clearly-defined motivation: companies want to maximise profit, governments want to maximise tax revenue. in fact, the alarmingly close connections between big business and government in russia - connections often greased by bribery - blur the apparently antagonistic relationship. companies can, for example, persuade officials to overlook non-payment of taxes.  and the authors' definition of tax enforcement seems unrealistically western. genuine, disinterested tax collection might well work wonders in russia; the problem with recent examples has been the erratic and unpredictable way laws are enforced. the case against yukos, for example, has moved in fits and starts, with little clarity from the government about its intentions, and little faith from investors that the letter of the law would be followed. as far as most commentators are concerned, the state is pursuing yukos out of a political vendetta, rather than simply to enforce fiscal rectitude. since yukos' founder, mikhail khodorkovsky, was arrested a year ago, the russian market has dropped by 10% - an indication that few investors feel optimistic about the salutary effect on corporate performance.","but it argues that more rigorous tax policing has benefited all russian firms, even targets of the tax police.the calculations demonstrated what many russian analysts already knew: that increasing the tax rate increases the amount that managers steal, since undeclared income becomes relatively more valuable.the net result, the authors say, is that the extra amount companies pay in tax is more than compensated for by greater efficiency and financial soundness.since then, the russian stock market has more than trebled in value, a rise the authors attribute at least in part to the newly tough approach.the report highlights the case of sibneft, a russian oil company that came close to merging with yukos last year.""an increase in tax enforcement can increase the amount [of dividends and other income] outside shareholders will receive, even accounting for increased levels of taxation,"" the authors say.according to the authors, although a variety of changes were sweeping through russian industry at the time, the increase in tax enforcement is the only likely explanation for the change of fortunes at sibneft and many of its peers.genuine, disinterested tax collection might well work wonders in russia; the problem with recent examples has been the erratic and unpredictable way laws are enforced.and the authors' definition of tax enforcement seems unrealistically western.the paper's reasoning is complex, and is based on a sophisticated model of the relationship between tax regimes and corporate governance - in particular, the propensity of management to steal from the company.on the other hand, increasing the rigour with which taxes are collected encourages companies to become more transparent, forcing them to be able to demonstrate their financial position far more accurately.for all its faults, corporate russia has become far more orderly and law-abiding since 2000."
"balco case trial date pushed back  the trial date for the bay area laboratory cooperative (balco) steroid distribution case has been postponed.  us judge susan illston pushed back a preliminary evidentiary hearing - which was due to take place on wednesday - until 6 june. no official trial date has been set but it is expected to begin in september. balco founder victor conte along with james valente, coach remy korchemny and trainer greg anderson are charged with distributing steroids to athletes.  anderson's clients include barry bonds, and several other baseball stars have been asked to appear before a congressional inquiry into steroid use in the major leagues. the balco defence team have already lost their appeal to have the case dismissed at a pre-trial hearing in san francisco but will still argue the case should not go to trial. the hearing in june will focus on the admissibility of evidence gathered during police raids on balco's offices and anderson's home. conte and anderson were not arrested at that point but federal agents did obtain statements from them. the defence are expected to challenge the legality of those interviews and if ilston agrees she could could reject all the evidence from the raids. balco has been accused by the united states anti-doping agency (usada) of being the source of the banned steroid thg and modafinil.  former double world champion kelli white and olympic relay star alvin harrison have both been banned on the basis of materials discovered during the balco investigation. britain's former european 100m champion dwain chambers is currently serving a two-year ban after testing positive for thg in an out-of-competition test in 2003. and american sprinter marion jones has filed a lawsuit for defamation against conte following his allegations that he gave her performance-enhancing drugs.","the trial date for the bay area laboratory cooperative (balco) steroid distribution case has been postponed.balco has been accused by the united states anti-doping agency (usada) of being the source of the banned steroid thg and modafinil.the balco defence team have already lost their appeal to have the case dismissed at a pre-trial hearing in san francisco but will still argue the case should not go to trial.balco founder victor conte along with james valente, coach remy korchemny and trainer greg anderson are charged with distributing steroids to athletes.no official trial date has been set but it is expected to begin in september.former double world champion kelli white and olympic relay star alvin harrison have both been banned on the basis of materials discovered during the balco investigation."
"box office blow for alexander  director oliver stone's historical epic alexander has failed in its bid to conquer the box office, entering the us film charts at number six.  the swords and sandals blockbuster, rumoured to have cost more than $150m (£79m) to make, earned just $13.5 (£7m) over three days at the us box office. due to the thanksgiving holiday, the film opened on wednesday, bringing its total takings to $21.6m (£11.4m). top of the box office for a second week was action movie national treasure. the family adventure, starring nicolas cage, took $33.1m (£17.m), ahead of animated comedy the incredibles - now in its fourth week in the charts - which took $24.1m (£12.7m).  last week oliver stone's film met with scathing reviews from us critics. the film stars irish actor colin farrell as one of history's most celebrated leaders - a relentless and arrogant warrior who conquered much of the known world by the age of 25. in particular, its portrayal of alexander as a bisexual has met with a hostile reception and the threat of legal action from greek lawyers. ""though the battles have the blood-and-sinew bravado you expect from oliver stone, this three-hour buttnumbathon is hamstrung by a hectoring grandiosity,"" wrote one reviewer in rolling stone magazine. others poured scorn on farrell's bleached hair and angelina jolie's unwieldy accent, which variety called ""a combination of mata hari and count dracula"" . but novelist gore vidal defended the film, saying it was ""barrier-breaking"" for its frank depiction of bisexuality.  in sweden last thursday, to pick up a lifetime achievement award at the stockholm international film festival, stone expressed the hope that alexander might be better appreciated in europe.

"kinnock to urge reform in lords  neil kinnock has said his acceptance of a seat in the house of lords will allow him to help ""achieve further progress with substantial democratic reform.""  on the bbc's breakfast with frost it was put to mr kinnock that he had once referred to lords members as ""brigands, muggers, bribers and gangsters"". but the outgoing european commissioner said his comments - made some 26 years ago - needed to be put in context. he said advocates for reform needed to be inside the lords to vote for it. ""it was pointed out to me that if the additional democratic reform is going to take place it is going to require advocates in the lords and people there willing to vote for it.""  mr kinnock added that the second factor behind his acceptance of the peerage was his appointment as chairman of the british council.

"blunkett unveils policing plans  people could be given the mobile phone number of their local bobby under an overhaul of policing in england and wales unveiled by david blunkett.  the plans include a dedicated policing team for each neighbourhood and a 10 point compulsory customer charter. the home secretary said targets would be put in place to ensure that the public got a good response from police. local people would also be able to ""trigger"" action on specific problems if they felt nothing was being done. local councillors would have to show certain conditions had been met before invoking the power. and police could refuse the request if the complaints were frivolous, would only cause annoyance or would pose too heavy a burden on resources.  mr blunkett said a new three digit number would be created for non-emergency phone calls to police. the best performing police services would get more cash and extra freedoms, he said, but he would not shirk from stepping in where the public was being failed. the home secretary's powers to suspend or sack chief constables are being reviewed after mr blunkett's battle with humberside chief david westwood over intelligence failures on soham murderer ian huntley.  opposition parties also want more local policing to tackle nuisance behaviour and other crime but they accuse ministers of tying the police up with paperwork. tory spokesman david davis said the proposals were ""little more than a taxpayer-funded pr exercise"" ahead of a general election predicted for next may.  police forces were already ""buried"" under existing government initiatives and there was little in the latest plans to reassure them,"" said mr davis. earlier lib dem home affairs spokesman mark oaten said the government was right to want to increase the links between local people and the police.

"time to get tough on friendlies?  for an international manager, a friendly provides an important opportunity to work with your players.  the only problem is that the game itself can often be a farce. some people have been saying it would be better to get the players together for the week, and do away with the 90 minutes at the end.  i would say it's 50-50 whether you should have these games or not, and if you look at it that way you would probably say you're better not doing so. it would certainly keep club managers happy, as it would reduce the risk of players returning to domestic duty injured. but international bosses will tell you that scrapping friendlies is counterproductive because the only way for a team to get better is by playing. the more you play together, the easier it is when it comes to the crunch in games like world cup quarter-finals against brazil. often in friendlies, though, a manager will play his strongest side for the first 45 minutes and then send out an entirely different one in the second half. and it's very difficult for any player to come on as substitute in a side with a few changes, let alone a whole team's worth. the debate will rage on, and i'm not sure there is a satisfactory solution. one manager who has got it right this week is walter smith. the new scotland manager has decided to have a training camp instead of a friendly for his first international week since replacing berti vogts. it is the sort of move you would expect from walter, who is a canny manager.  the players have had such a hard time recently that he is better off getting them together in a relaxed atmosphere and trying to generate some team spirit before the next world cup qualifiers. if he had sent them out on wednesday and they had been badly beaten, it would have done them no good whatsoever. john toshack has his first game in charge of wales, and it will be important for him to get a decent result against hungary. he will have his own ideas on individuals and how to play and will probably look more at the performance, but the public wants results. it's extremely difficult to get the balance for friendlies. if you win, people forget them, but if you lose it becomes a stat that can be used against you. england's game against holland is a good example. it looks like a good opportunity to try out players like middlesbrough winger stewart downing or crystal palace striker andy johnson. but you have got to remember sven-goran eriksson's side were given a lesson by spain in the last game they played.  the injury problems in defence should at least give the likes of wes brown and jamie carragher a chance to impress. for the club managers, it will simply be a case of waiting at home with fingers crossed.","some people have been saying it would be better to get the players together for the week, and do away with the 90 minutes at the end.i would say it's 50-50 whether you should have these games or not, and if you look at it that way you would probably say you're better not doing so.it would certainly keep club managers happy, as it would reduce the risk of players returning to domestic duty injured.the more you play together, the easier it is when it comes to the crunch in games like world cup quarter-finals against brazil.often in friendlies, though, a manager will play his strongest side for the first 45 minutes and then send out an entirely different one in the second half.it is the sort of move you would expect from walter, who is a canny manager.john toshack has his first game in charge of wales, and it will be important for him to get a decent result against hungary.one manager who has got it right this week is walter smith.the new scotland manager has decided to have a training camp instead of a friendly for his first international week since replacing berti vogts.the only problem is that the game itself can often be a farce."

"lasting influence of legend charles  ray charles, who has won a string of posthumous grammy awards, belonged to a pioneering generation of artists that had a huge influence on the course of rock and pop music.  his sound encompassed so many styles - blues, gospel, jazz, rock 'n' roll, even country - and had a real impact on the nascent uk beat and r&b scenes.  compared in stature to elvis presley by some commentators, charles' songs cast their spell on such 1960s stalwarts as joe cocker, steve winwood, eric burdon and van morrison. his influence has extended to contemporary artists such as norah jones, with whom he recently recorded a duet. if james brown was the godfather of soul, then ray charles was indisputably one of its founding fathers. along with sam cooke, he was instrumental in bringing together the gospel fervour of the deep south baptist church with the ""devil's"" music of r&b to pave the way for a new generation of soul artists.  without charles, it is hard to imagine the tear-stained atlantic r&b sound of aretha franklin, otis redding or wilson pickett. he was also a talented jazz composer, arranger and band leader, playing at the newport jazz festival and carnegie hall and recording with noted jazz musicians such as milt jackson and david ""fathead"" newman. unfortunately, he also shared another trait common among many jazz artists of the era - that of heroin addiction, which led to him being arrested in 1965. his string of 1950s atlantic r&b successes included songs that would be covered by the first-generation rock 'n' roll greats, including i've got a woman (roy orbison, elvis presley) and hallelujah, i love her so (eddie cochran). after the exuberance of his 1959 signature song what'd i say, charles turned towards a more pop-oriented style, recording hoagy carmichael's sentimental string ballad georgia on my mind, and the upbeat hit the road jack.  he also won acclaim in the country arena with his interpretations of hank williams standards such as your cheating heart and you win again. more than 40 years after its release, his 1962 abc album modern sounds in country and western music is still regarded as a classic. his version of don gibson's i can't stop loving you topped the pop and r&b charts in the us. in 1972, he made a rare foray into protest songs with his album a message from the people.  on it, he took a stand on poverty and civil rights - echoing similar recordings of the era from progeny such as stevie wonder, james brown, curtis mayfield and marvin gaye. more than 20 years later, he would embrace contemporary production with his 1993 album my world, which featured hip-hop beats - although charles claimed at the time not to know what hip-hop was. among the tributes that poured in from all sections of the music world when charles died aged 73 in june 2004 was one from his friend, the producer quincy jones, who described him as a ""brother in every sense of the word"". ""there will never be another musician who did as much to break down the perceived walls of musical genres as much as ray charles did,"" he said. former manfred mann singer paul jones, who sang on 1960s hits such as come tomorrow and sha la la, said charles was one of his heroes.

"tories unveil quango blitz plans  plans to abolish 162 quangos have been unveiled by the conservatives as part of their effort to show how government red tape can be cut.  six government units would also be scrapped under proposals which the tories say would save more than £4.3bn. among the targets are strategic health authorities and the new fair access regulator for universities. tory frontbencher john redwood said britain needed a slimmer government and lower taxes to be competitive.  the plans would abolish regional assemblies and other regional bodies, such as boards tackling industrial development and housing. their powers would be returned to elected local councils or national government. the tories say the strategic health authorities are not needed as it is better that local people, rather than officials, run hospitals and surgeries.  announcing the plans, mr redwood said: ""mr blair has forgotten the interests of taxpayers, and has broken the pledges he made. ""far from improving public services, spending taxpayers' money on quangos has led only to more bureaucrats, more regulation and higher taxes."" his party leader, michael howard, argued a change in direction was needed to get a grip on spending. ""labour are creating two britains: the britain of the forgotten majority and bureaucratic britain,"" he said. ""in the real world, people are working harder just to stand still. they've seen their pensions knocked for six. ""they're being squeezed by extra taxes. the forgotten majority are paying the price of bureaucratic britain."" the government has announced plans to cut 100,000 civil servants as part of its efficiency drive. the liberal democrats have said they would cut the number of whitehall departments to make sure money reaches frontline services.","six government units would also be scrapped under proposals which the tories say would save more than £4.3bn.tory frontbencher john redwood said britain needed a slimmer government and lower taxes to be competitive.the tories say the strategic health authorities are not needed as it is better that local people, rather than officials, run hospitals and surgeries.""labour are creating two britains: the britain of the forgotten majority and bureaucratic britain,"" he said.the government has announced plans to cut 100,000 civil servants as part of its efficiency drive.their powers would be returned to elected local councils or national government.the liberal democrats have said they would cut the number of whitehall departments to make sure money reaches frontline services."

"more women turn to net security  older people and women are increasingly taking charge of protecting home computers against malicious net attacks, according to a two-year study.  the number of women buying programs to protect pcs from virus, spam and spyware attacks rose by 11.2% each year between 2002 and 2004. the study, for net security firm preventon, shows that security messages are reaching a diversity of surfers. it is thought that 40% of those buying home net security programs are retired. for the last three years, that has gone up by an average of 13.2%. but more retired women (53%) were buying security software than retired men. the research reflects the changing stereotype and demographics of web users, as well as growing awareness of the greater risks that high-speed broadband net connections can pose to surfers.  the study predicts that 40% of all home pc net security buyers will be women in 2005. they could even overtake men as the main buyers by 2007, if current rates persist, according to the research. ""i think older people have become more vigilant about protecting their pcs as we tend to be more cautious and want an insurance policy in case something does go wrong"", said one over-60 woman who took part in the research.  ""you started off with young male stereotype computer users for last 10 years,"" paul goosens, head of preventon told the bbc news website. ""now we are seeing real people - both sexes and very often it is women who have more access at home."" but net service providers still need to take more responsibility in making sure people are educated about net threats before they go online, particuarly if they are new to broadband, he said.  programs also need to be tailored so that they can be installed by dial-up users with a slower connection too, said mr goosens. security software should be easy to use, with simple interfaces and instructions written in non-technical language, he added. the nature of the security threats are also becoming more than just about e-mail viruses. high-profile complaints about rogue diallers, and spyware or other programs that surreptitiously install themselves on computers, have also raised awareness about the need to have a combination of anti-virus, firewall and spyware-removal programs too. without protection, these kinds of programs can be picked up just through surfing the web normally.  more than 30,000 pcs a day globally are being recruited into networks that spread spam and viruses, a study from security from symantec showed last year. viruses written to make headlines by infecting millions are also getting rarer, according to net security experts. programs are being unleashed to directly profit criminal gangs, many based in eastern europe, over those which are designed to show off technical skills or cause nuisance. the research shows that more people are taking these criminal net threats more seriously because, said mr goosens, they are reported in the press much more. ""you are seeing older users being educated by the media and are seeing them picking up on this threat. they are asking the right questions,"" he explained. ""it is more likely the younger users who naively assume that because they are using a reputable service provider, that they are safe to connect to the net."" an unprotected computer on a broadband connection can be breached and infected with viruses or spyware within minutes. by the end of the year it is thought that more than 30% of uk homes will have broadband net access. in july last year, the number of uk households accessing the net via broadband surpassed those using dial-up for the first time, according to the office of national statistics.","it is thought that 40% of those buying home net security programs are retired.the study predicts that 40% of all home pc net security buyers will be women in 2005.older people and women are increasingly taking charge of protecting home computers against malicious net attacks, according to a two-year study.the study, for net security firm preventon, shows that security messages are reaching a diversity of surfers.but net service providers still need to take more responsibility in making sure people are educated about net threats before they go online, particuarly if they are new to broadband, he said.by the end of the year it is thought that more than 30% of uk homes will have broadband net access.the research shows that more people are taking these criminal net threats more seriously because, said mr goosens, they are reported in the press much more.viruses written to make headlines by infecting millions are also getting rarer, according to net security experts.but more retired women (53%) were buying security software than retired men.in july last year, the number of uk households accessing the net via broadband surpassed those using dial-up for the first time, according to the office of national statistics.the number of women buying programs to protect pcs from virus, spam and spyware attacks rose by 11.2% each year between 2002 and 2004.more than 30,000 pcs a day globally are being recruited into networks that spread spam and viruses, a study from security from symantec showed last year."
"bad e-mail habits sustains spam  the 'bad behaviour' of e-mail users is helping to sustain the spam industry, a new study has found.  according to a survey conducted by security firm mirapoint and market research company the radicati group, nearly a third of e-mail users have clicked on links in spam messages. one in ten users have bought products advertised in junk mail. clicking on a link in a spam message can expose people to viruses and alert spammers to live e-mail accounts.  the fact that one in ten e-mail users are buying things advertised in spam continues to make it an attractive business, especially given that sending out huge amounts of spam costs very little, the report concludes. ""this preliminary data is surprising and somewhat shocking to us,"" said marcel nienhuis, market analyst at the radicati group.

""without casting aspersions, those likely to respond to these kind of adverts will be invariably hoping that 'one thing leads to another' but aside from the fact that these mails are bogus, clicking on any link within a spam mail can lead to a whole host of unwanted problems,"" said alyn hockey, clearswift's director of research.  sexually explicit terms make up 14% of security firm sophos' top 50 word that spammers most commonly try to disguise in order to beat anti-spam filters. spammers will deliberately misspell a word or use digits instead of letters in an attempt to by-pass anti-spam software, said graham cluley, senior technology consultant for security firm sophos.

"radcliffe proves doubters wrong  this won't go down as one of the greatest marathons of paula's career. but as a test of character, it was the toughest race she's ever taken part in.  a win in the new york marathon doesn't make up for the disappointment of athens in any shape or form, but it will offer hope and reassurance for next year. if paula's last experience of the year had been athens, it would have been very difficult to look forward with any optimism. she can now draw a line under this year and make plans about her future. even if she'd lost this race, there would have been a lot of positives to take out of it. she knows she can dig deep if she needs to. it was a strong field, with a number of the girls going into the race with expectations of winning. and although two hours 23 minutes wasn't one of paula's best times, it wasn't far off the record on a difficult course.  i was speaking to paula in the lead-up to this race and she said that in many ways she was facing a no-win situation. she thought that if she won, people would say ""why couldn't she do that in athens?"" and if she lost, people would say her career was over. and a lot of people were wondering what would happen if paula was forced to drop out of this race, as she did in the marathon and 10,000m in athens. but that was never on the cards. she might have been beaten, but she would have kept running. the reasons she was forced to pull out in athens - the niggling injuries, her lack of energy and the oppressive conditions - weren't at play here. the only question was what position she could finish in. most important of all, despite all the hype in the media ahead of this race, there were never doubts in paula's mind. if she wasn't confident, she wouldn't have run. after all, if you're the best in the world at an event, you'll always have expectations of winning.  now paula will take part in the run london 10km race in london at the end of the year, have a well-earned rest over christmas and go into next year with a lot of optimism.","and a lot of people were wondering what would happen if paula was forced to drop out of this race, as she did in the marathon and 10,000m in athens.and if she lost, people would say her career was over.i was speaking to paula in the lead-up to this race and she said that in many ways she was facing a no-win situation.if paula's last experience of the year had been athens, it would have been very difficult to look forward with any optimism.it was a strong field, with a number of the girls going into the race with expectations of winning.now paula will take part in the run london 10km race in london at the end of the year, have a well-earned rest over christmas and go into next year with a lot of optimism.even if she'd lost this race, there would have been a lot of positives to take out of it.but that was never on the cards.she thought that if she won, people would say ""why couldn't she do that in athens?"""
"chancellor rallies labour voters  gordon brown has issued a rallying cry, telling supporters the ""stakes are too high"" to stay at home or protest vote in the forthcoming general election.  the chancellor said the vote - expected to fall on 5 may - will give a ""clear and fundamental"" choice between labour investment and conservative cuts. speaking at labour's spring conference in gateshead, mr brown claimed the nhs was not safe in conservative hands. he said tory plans to cut £35bn tax would ""cut deep into public service"".  to a packed audience at gateshead's sage centre, the chancellor said the cuts proposed by shadow chancellor oliver letwin were the equivalent of sacking every teacher, gp and nurse in the country, he told activists. laying into the conservative's record in government he said: ""i give you this promise - with labour, britain will never return to the mistakes of erm and 10% inflation, 15% interest rates, £3bn in lost reserves, 250,000 repossessed, one million in negative equity and three million unemployed. ""never again tory boom and bust.  ""this will be the central dividing line at the election, between a conservative party taking britain back and planning deep cuts of £35bn in our services, and a labour government taking britain forward, which on a platform of stability will reform and renew our hospitals, schools and public services and, i am proud to say, spend by 2008 £60bn more."" turning to the economy, the chancellor pledged to continue economic stability and growth in a third term in power.  he said after seven years labour had transformed from a party not trusted with the economy to ""the only party trusted with the economy"". it was now a ""party not just of employees, but of employers and managers"", he said. in the speech - which prompted a standing ovation from an audience clearly ""warm"" to mr brown - he also promised to end teenage unemployment within the next five years. he also highlighted plans for 100% debt relief for the world's poorest countries, a national minimum wage for 16 and 17-year-olds and the creation of a network of children's centres and flexibility in maternity leave. the prime minister is to take part later on saturday in an interactive question and answer session, fielding queries sent in by e-mail, text message and telephone as part of labour's attempt to engage the public in their campaign.","he said tory plans to cut £35bn tax would ""cut deep into public service"".""this will be the central dividing line at the election, between a conservative party taking britain back and planning deep cuts of £35bn in our services, and a labour government taking britain forward, which on a platform of stability will reform and renew our hospitals, schools and public services and, i am proud to say, spend by 2008 £60bn more.""the chancellor said the vote - expected to fall on 5 may - will give a ""clear and fundamental"" choice between labour investment and conservative cuts.he said after seven years labour had transformed from a party not trusted with the economy to ""the only party trusted with the economy"".it was now a ""party not just of employees, but of employers and managers"", he said.to a packed audience at gateshead's sage centre, the chancellor said the cuts proposed by shadow chancellor oliver letwin were the equivalent of sacking every teacher, gp and nurse in the country, he told activists."
"blunkett sorry over murder plan  david blunkett has apologised to mps after the home office announced ""prematurely"" via press release a review of murder laws.  the home secretary confirmed the review was to get under way in the wake of a law commission report which branded the current murder law as ""a mess"". he said the review would look at partial defences to murder, including provocation and at mandatory sentences. the home office has already said the review will begin next year.  on wednesday, a home office spokeswoman said the terms of reference for the review had not been established but it was likely to include only england and wales. news of the review was released because it was thought mr blunkett would make the official announcement in a commons debate on wednesday. but the announcement never came, with the home secretary saying the debate had never reached that stage. amid opposition anger, mr blunkett had to answer an emergency question in parliament on thursday. he said he had taken steps to ensure the incident was not repeated. shadow home secretary david davis welcomed his ""gracious apology"" and the review itself. but he argued the minister should have volunteered a formal statement instead of having to be ""dragged"" to face mps.  in its report, the law commission said it had found wide support among criminal justice professionals for an end to the mandatory life sentence for murder. the panel suggested different kinds of murders could be ""graded"" to recognise the seriousness of the offence.  but the home office said mandatory life sentences would not be abolished and argued courts already had flexibility. the commission, an independent body including two judges, a senior barrister and sentencing experts, had been asked to consider reforms to the defence of provocation in murder cases. but it said its proposals were unlikely to work without a far wider review of the law. results of a consultation exercise showed 64 respondents out of 146 - among them 21 judges - believed a mandatory life sentence for every murder was ""indefensible and should cease"".  a key question was whether one category should continue to cover all types of murder from mercy killings to serial or contract killings. the commission found support for the idea of grading murders so that the sentence reflected the seriousness of the offence. but speaking after the report was published, home office minister baroness scotland said: ""murder is the most serious of crimes and we have no intention of abolishing the mandatory life sentence. ""where an offender is convicted of murder, the court must pass a life sentence."" the commission also recommended tightening the law so that the provocation defence cannot be used in cases where someone has killed for revenge, such as a jealous husband who murders an unfaithful wife.","but speaking after the report was published, home office minister baroness scotland said: ""murder is the most serious of crimes and we have no intention of abolishing the mandatory life sentence.the home secretary confirmed the review was to get under way in the wake of a law commission report which branded the current murder law as ""a mess"".in its report, the law commission said it had found wide support among criminal justice professionals for an end to the mandatory life sentence for murder.but the home office said mandatory life sentences would not be abolished and argued courts already had flexibility.he said the review would look at partial defences to murder, including provocation and at mandatory sentences.david blunkett has apologised to mps after the home office announced ""prematurely"" via press release a review of murder laws.the home office has already said the review will begin next year.on wednesday, a home office spokeswoman said the terms of reference for the review had not been established but it was likely to include only england and wales.results of a consultation exercise showed 64 respondents out of 146 - among them 21 judges - believed a mandatory life sentence for every murder was ""indefensible and should cease""."

"warning over tsunami aid website  net users are being told to avoid a scam website that claims to collect cash on behalf of tsunami victims.  the site looks plausible because it uses an old version of the official disasters emergency committee webpage. however, dec has no connection with the fake site and says it has contacted the police about it. the site is just the latest in a long list of scams that try to cash in on the goodwill generated by the tsunami disaster.  the link to the website is contained in a spam e-mail that is currently circulating. the message's subject line reads ""urgent tsunami earthquake appeal"" and its text bears all the poor grammar and bad spelling that characterises many other phishing attempts. the web address of the fake site is decuk.org which could be close enough to the official www.dec.org.uk address to confuse some people keen to donate. patricia sanders, spokeswoman for the disaster emergency committee said it was aware of the site and had contacted the computer crime unit at scotland yard to help get it shut down. she said the spam e-mails directing people to the site started circulating two days ago shortly after the domain name of the site was registered. it is thought that the fake site is being run from romania. ms sanders said dec had contacted us net registrars who handle domain ownership and the net hosting firm that is keeping the site on the web.  dec was going to push for all cash donated via the site to be handed over to the official organisation. bt and dec's hosting company were also making efforts to get the site shut down, she said.  ms sanders said sending out spam e-mail to solicit donations was not dec's style and that it would never canvass support in this way. she said that dec hoped to get the fake site shut down as soon as possible. all attempts by the bbc news website to contact the people behind the site have failed. none of the e-mail addresses supplied on the site work and the real owner of the domain is obscured in publicly available net records. this is not the first attempt to cash in on the outpouring of goodwill that has accompanied appeals for tsunami aid. one e-mail sent out in early january came from someone who claimed that he had lost his parents in the disaster and was asking for help moving an inheritance from a bank account in the netherlands. the con was very similar to the familiar nigerian forward fee fraud e-mails that milk money out of people by promising them a cut of a much larger cash pile. other scam e-mails included a link to a website that supposedly let people donate money but instead loaded spyware on their computers that grabbed confidential information. in a monthly report anti-virus firm sophos said that two e-mail messages about the tsunami made it to the top 10 hoax list during january. another tsunami-related e-mail is also circulating that carries the zar worm which tries to spread via the familiar route of microsoft's outlook e-mail program. anyone opening the attachment of the mail will have their contact list plundered by the worm keen to find new addresses to send itself to.","she said the spam e-mails directing people to the site started circulating two days ago shortly after the domain name of the site was registered.she said that dec hoped to get the fake site shut down as soon as possible.the site is just the latest in a long list of scams that try to cash in on the goodwill generated by the tsunami disaster.patricia sanders, spokeswoman for the disaster emergency committee said it was aware of the site and had contacted the computer crime unit at scotland yard to help get it shut down.ms sanders said dec had contacted us net registrars who handle domain ownership and the net hosting firm that is keeping the site on the web.dec was going to push for all cash donated via the site to be handed over to the official organisation.none of the e-mail addresses supplied on the site work and the real owner of the domain is obscured in publicly available net records.all attempts by the bbc news website to contact the people behind the site have failed.bt and dec's hosting company were also making efforts to get the site shut down, she said.the web address of the fake site is decuk.org which could be close enough to the official www.dec.org.uk address to confuse some people keen to donate."

"us cyber security chief resigns  the man making sure us computer networks are safe and secure has resigned after only a year in his post.  amit yoran was director of the national cyber security division within the us department of homeland security created following the 9/11 attacks. the division was tasked with improving us defences against malicious hackers, viruses and other net-based threats. reports suggest he left because his division was not given enough clout within the larger organisation.  mr yoran took up his post in september 2003 and his first task was to get the cyber security division up and running. the organisation had a staff of about 60 people and a budget of about $80m (£44.54m). the division was charged with thinking up and carrying out action to make us networks more impervious to attack and disruption by the viruses, worms and hack attacks that have become commonplace.  in the last 12 months mr yoran oversaw the creation of a cyber alert system that sends out warnings about big hitting viruses and net attacks as they occur. the warnings also contained information about how firms and organisations could protect themselves against these attacks. the cyber security division also audited us government networks to discover exactly what was sitting on which network. the next step was to be the creation of a scanning system to identify vulnerabilities that made federal networks and machines susceptible to attack by malicious hackers and virus writers. mr yoran's division was also doing work to identify the networks and machines that had been broken into by cyber criminals. despite this success mr yoran left his post abruptly at the end of last week, reportedly only giving one day's notice to bosses at the department of homeland security. ""amit yoran has been a valuable contributor on cyber security issues over the past year, and we appreciate his efforts in starting the department's cybersecurity program,"" said a department of homeland security spokeswoman. some reports have suggested that mr yoran felt frustrated by the lack of prominence given to work to protect against net-based threats in the wider homeland organisation. an attempt by us politicians to pass a law to promote mr yoran and raise the profile of his department's work is now mired in congress.","amit yoran was director of the national cyber security division within the us department of homeland security created following the 9/11 attacks.the cyber security division also audited us government networks to discover exactly what was sitting on which network.mr yoran took up his post in september 2003 and his first task was to get the cyber security division up and running.mr yoran's division was also doing work to identify the networks and machines that had been broken into by cyber criminals.the division was tasked with improving us defences against malicious hackers, viruses and other net-based threats.reports suggest he left because his division was not given enough clout within the larger organisation.some reports have suggested that mr yoran felt frustrated by the lack of prominence given to work to protect against net-based threats in the wider homeland organisation."
"ex-boeing director gets jail term  an ex-chief financial officer at boeing has received a four-month jail sentence and a fine of $250,000 (£131,961) for illegally hiring a top air force aide.  michael sears admitted his guilt in breaking conflict of interest laws by recruiting darleen druyun while she still handled military contracts. ms druyun is currently serving a nine month sentence for favouring boeing when awarding lucrative contracts. boeing lost a $23bn government contract after a pentagon inquiry into the case. the contract, to provide refuelling tankers for the us air force, was cancelled last year.  the pentagon revealed earlier this week that it would examine eight other contracts worth $3bn which it believes may have been tainted by ms druyun's role in the procurement process. boeing sacked mr sears and ms druyun in november 2003 after allegations that they had violated company recruitment policy. ms druyun had talks with mr sears in october 2002 about working for boeing, while she was still a top procurement official within the pentagon. she subsequently joined the company in january 2003. ms druyun admitted that she had steered multi-billion dollar contracts to boeing and other favoured companies.  in documents filed in a virginia court ahead of mr sears' sentencing, prosecutors blamed boeing's senior management for failing to ask key questions about the ""legal and ethical issues"" surrounding ms druyun's appointment. mr sears told prosecutors that no other boeing officials were aware that ms druyun was still responsible for major procurement decisions at the time she was discussing a job with boeing. however, analysts believe boeing may yet face civil charges arising from the scandal. the pentagon has investigated 400 contracts, dating back to 1993, since the allegations against ms druyun came to light.  boeing's corporate ethics have come under scrutiny on several occasions in recent years. boeing was sued by lockheed martin after its rival accused it of industrial espionage during a 1998 contract competition. boeing apologised publicly for the affair - although it claimed it did not gain any unfair advantage - and pledged to improve its procedures. the pentagon subsequently revoked $1bn worth of contracts assigned to boeing and prohibited the seattle-based company from future rocket work.","ms druyun had talks with mr sears in october 2002 about working for boeing, while she was still a top procurement official within the pentagon.mr sears told prosecutors that no other boeing officials were aware that ms druyun was still responsible for major procurement decisions at the time she was discussing a job with boeing.boeing sacked mr sears and ms druyun in november 2003 after allegations that they had violated company recruitment policy.ms druyun admitted that she had steered multi-billion dollar contracts to boeing and other favoured companies.the pentagon subsequently revoked $1bn worth of contracts assigned to boeing and prohibited the seattle-based company from future rocket work.boeing lost a $23bn government contract after a pentagon inquiry into the case.ms druyun is currently serving a nine month sentence for favouring boeing when awarding lucrative contracts.boeing was sued by lockheed martin after its rival accused it of industrial espionage during a 1998 contract competition."

"black sabbath top rock album poll  black sabbath have topped a list of the best british rock albums of all time.  the band once fronted by ozzy osbourne led a poll of kerrang! magazine readers with their 1970 self-titled debut. the band have three more efforts on the list, including fifth-placed paranoid. osbourne appears more than any other act, with two solo records featured. the top five includes led zeppelin, iron maiden and sex pistols. queen, muse, manic street preachers and the clash complete the top 10. a mix of heavy metal, punk, glam rock and even dance music makes up the list. motorhead, judas priest and prodigy are included along with newer acts like the darkness and lostprophets.  kerrang! editor ashley bird said: ""it's amazing to see so many incredible homegrown albums in one list, and without any of the abysmal fashion bands that currently clog up the music scene. ""these are the real opinions of proper rock fans.""  formed by four teenage friends in the west midlands in the late 1960s, black sabbath are one of britain's most successful heavy rock bands. their debut was a uk top 10 hit in 1970 and sold more than a million copies in the us. osbourne said the band's success in the kerrang! poll was a triumph for british rock. he said: ""back then you'd hear: 'if you go to san francisco, be sure to wear a flower in your hair'. ""we lived in aston, birmingham. the only flowers i ever saw were on a gravestone in our local cemetery."" despite being disliked by many critics, black sabbath's subsequent albums included multi-million sellers but internal rows led to osbourne leaving in 1979. the band continued without osbourne, who went on to solo success but also had to battle alcoholism and legal action over his music allegedly inciting teenagers to commit suicide. he was eventually cleared of the charges. osbourne, who bit off the head of a live bat on stage in 1982, rejoined the band to play the live aid charity concert in 1985. after many changes in line-up, the original four members reunited to play live dates in 1997. black sabbath have reunited regularly in recent years while osbourne has gone on to wider fame with his family through mtv documentary series the osbournes.","the band once fronted by ozzy osbourne led a poll of kerrang!osbourne said the band's success in the kerrang!black sabbath have topped a list of the best british rock albums of all time.poll was a triumph for british rock.despite being disliked by many critics, black sabbath's subsequent albums included multi-million sellers but internal rows led to osbourne leaving in 1979.editor ashley bird said: ""it's amazing to see so many incredible homegrown albums in one list, and without any of the abysmal fashion bands that currently clog up the music scene.their debut was a uk top 10 hit in 1970 and sold more than a million copies in the us.the band continued without osbourne, who went on to solo success but also had to battle alcoholism and legal action over his music allegedly inciting teenagers to commit suicide.formed by four teenage friends in the west midlands in the late 1960s, black sabbath are one of britain's most successful heavy rock bands.osbourne, who bit off the head of a live bat on stage in 1982, rejoined the band to play the live aid charity concert in 1985."
"henson stakes early lions claim  the six nations may be a glittering prize in itself but every player from the four home unions will also have one eye on a possible trip to new zealand with the lions this summer.  the player who staked the biggest claim for a place in the starting xv over the weekend was gavin henson. he's very confident. you just had to listen to his interview afterwards - he beamed with confidence - but although there's an element of arrogance it's good arrogance. he certainly showed some nice touches. he once showed a clean pair of heels to mathew tait when he got outside him, his defence was very good and he made some great kicks out of hand. and that's without even mentioning his majestic match-winning penalty. but i think we need to wait and see what happens because he needs to be put to the test. he needs to come up against brian o'driscoll or a big french midfield. wales fly-half stephen jones was another player who impressed me. he gave good direction, he was very confident and he was a nice general for his side. he showed he can control a game. with jonny wilkinson not playing at the moment due to inury the number 10 shirt could be up for grabs and jones, or maybe even henson, could make the lions team at fly-half.  jones stuck his hand up and he certainly looks a better bet than charlie hodgson after saturday's game. some of the wales forwards surprised me because i thought they would be out-muscled in the tight five. england prop julian white is a capable player but when it comes down to selection gethin jenkins is now going to have the upper hand because he came out on top. however, i still think white and phil vickery will be in the frame. some english players did their cause no harm. i thought joe worsley had a solid game and jason robinson and josh lewsey both did nothing wrong. but it looked too soon for young mathew tait and i think it will be a while before we see him again. despite being written off beforehand several scots caught my eye against france.  tom smith has been there and done it before, but the likes of chris cusiter, jason white and ally hogg all made their mark. hogg made a couple of good runs while white had a pretty robust game - his defence is right up there. cusiter looked very lively and he could be a very good option for lions coach sir clive woodward. the star of ireland's win over italy in rome looks like a certainty to make the starting xv against new zealand. brian o'driscoll is a class act. he ran some good lines against italy, made the breaks and fed his outside backs, although italy defended man on man which made it easy for him. gordon d'arcy was unlucky to go off injured early on but i think you could get a henson, d'arcy, o'driscoll combination in the lions midfield. paul o'connell just needs to add a hard edge to his game and malcolm o'kelly keeps on going and seems to be putting his hand up, while shane byrne seems to be a lively character. but they will be a bit worried after the italian pack drove them off their own ball on sunday, although i used to play in italy and i know how difficult it can be. one player who didn't impress me was wales scrum-half dwayne peel. he choked late on in the second half when wales were trailing. they had good possession and he kicked the ball away - i wouldn't want him as my lions scrum-half after that.","he once showed a clean pair of heels to mathew tait when he got outside him, his defence was very good and he made some great kicks out of hand.wales fly-half stephen jones was another player who impressed me.he gave good direction, he was very confident and he was a nice general for his side.one player who didn't impress me was wales scrum-half dwayne peel.hogg made a couple of good runs while white had a pretty robust game - his defence is right up there.gordon d'arcy was unlucky to go off injured early on but i think you could get a henson, d'arcy, o'driscoll combination in the lions midfield.the player who staked the biggest claim for a place in the starting xv over the weekend was gavin henson.cusiter looked very lively and he could be a very good option for lions coach sir clive woodward.he ran some good lines against italy, made the breaks and fed his outside backs, although italy defended man on man which made it easy for him.they had good possession and he kicked the ball away - i wouldn't want him as my lions scrum-half after that.he showed he can control a game.with jonny wilkinson not playing at the moment due to inury the number 10 shirt could be up for grabs and jones, or maybe even henson, could make the lions team at fly-half.the six nations may be a glittering prize in itself but every player from the four home unions will also have one eye on a possible trip to new zealand with the lions this summer.jones stuck his hand up and he certainly looks a better bet than charlie hodgson after saturday's game."

"mps criticise child access system  divorced parents seeking access to their children are often disadvantaged by the legal system, mps have said.  the constitutional affairs select committee said parents with custody could exploit delays in the system to stop former partners gaining access. courts should be used as a last resort, but where they are, their orders should be enforced more rigorously, mps said. but they rejected the claim made by some campaign groups that there should be a legal presumption of equal access.  currently the presumption is that the interests of the child are paramount. ""an arbitrary 'template' imposed on all families, whatever the needs of the child, would relegate the welfare of individual children to a secondary position,"" the mps said.  they said the law should be changed to require family courts specifically to take account of the importance of sustaining the relationship between the child and the non-resident parent in contested cases. this would ""reassert the rights of non-resident parents to contact with their children, as well as the rights of children to contact with both their parents, while maintaining sufficient flexibility to cope with issues of safety"", they said. delays in court hearings and the inability to effectively enforce court orders allowed ""a new 'status quo' arrangement for the children to become established by default"", they said.  ""although the courts rigorously avoid conscious bias, there are considerable grounds for accepting that non-resident parents are frequently disadvantaged by the system as it is administered at present. ""given the strong animosity between the parties which is common in contested family cases, we find it hard to believe that tactical delay is not sometimes used to the advantage of resident parents."" committee chairman alan beith said the five-month inquiry had been a ""complex and emotive"" one. ""at the moment, far too many contact and residency cases are being dealt with by the courts when they could be better resolved through professional mediation and negotiation,"" he said. ""this situation has to change. the court system should only be used as a last resort, where mediation and negotiation have completely broken down or where issues of abuse or domestic violence need to be dealt with.

"worldcom ex-boss launches defence  lawyers defending former worldcom chief bernie ebbers against a battery of fraud charges have called a company whistleblower as their first witness.  cynthia cooper, worldcom's ex-head of internal accounting, alerted directors to irregular accounting practices at the us telecoms giant in 2002. her warnings led to the collapse of the firm following the discovery of an $11bn (£5.7bn) accounting fraud. mr ebbers has pleaded not guilty to charges of fraud and conspiracy.  prosecution lawyers have argued that mr ebbers orchestrated a series of accounting tricks at worldcom, ordering employees to hide expenses and inflate revenues to meet wall street earnings estimates. but ms cooper, who now runs her own consulting business, told a jury in new york on wednesday that external auditors arthur andersen had approved worldcom's accounting in early 2001 and 2002. she said andersen had given a ""green light"" to the procedures and practices used by worldcom. mr ebber's lawyers have said he was unaware of the fraud, arguing that auditors did not alert him to any problems.  ms cooper also said that during shareholder meetings mr ebbers often passed over technical questions to the company's finance chief, giving only ""brief"" answers himself. the prosecution's star witness, former worldcom financial chief scott sullivan, has said that mr ebbers ordered accounting adjustments at the firm, telling him to ""hit our books"". however, ms cooper said mr sullivan had not mentioned ""anything uncomfortable"" about worldcom's accounting during a 2001 audit committee meeting. mr ebbers could face a jail sentence of 85 years if convicted of all the charges he is facing. worldcom emerged from bankruptcy protection in 2004, and is now known as mci. last week, mci agreed to a buyout by verizon communications in a deal valued at $6.75bn.","the prosecution's star witness, former worldcom financial chief scott sullivan, has said that mr ebbers ordered accounting adjustments at the firm, telling him to ""hit our books"".however, ms cooper said mr sullivan had not mentioned ""anything uncomfortable"" about worldcom's accounting during a 2001 audit committee meeting.mr ebber's lawyers have said he was unaware of the fraud, arguing that auditors did not alert him to any problems.mr ebbers has pleaded not guilty to charges of fraud and conspiracy.ms cooper also said that during shareholder meetings mr ebbers often passed over technical questions to the company's finance chief, giving only ""brief"" answers himself.prosecution lawyers have argued that mr ebbers orchestrated a series of accounting tricks at worldcom, ordering employees to hide expenses and inflate revenues to meet wall street earnings estimates."
"format wars could 'confuse users'  technology firms sony, philips, matsushita and samsung are developing a common way to stop people pirating digital music and video.  the firms want to make a system that ensures files play on the hardware they make but also thwarts illegal copying. the move could mean more confusion for consumers already faced by many different, and conflicting, content control systems, experts warned. they say there are no guarantees the system will even prevent piracy.  currently many online stores wrap up downloadable files in an own-brand control system that means they can only be played on a small number of media players. systems that limit what people can do with the files they download are known as digital rights management systems. by setting up the alliance to work on a common control system, the firms said they hope to end this current fragmentation of file formats. in a joint statement the firms said they wanted to let consumers enjoy ""appropriately licensed video and music on any device, independent of how they originally obtained that content"". the firms hope that it will also make it harder for consumers to make illegal copies of the music, movies and other digital content they have bought. called the marlin joint development association, the alliance will define basic specifications that every device made by the electronics firms will conform to. marlin will be built on technology from rights management firm intertrust as well as an earlier drm system developed by a group known as the coral consortium.  the move is widely seen as a way for the four firms to decide their own destiny on content control systems instead of having to sign up for those being pushed by apple and microsoft. confusingly for consumers, the technology that comes out of the alliance will sit alongside the content control systems of rival firms such as microsoft and apple. ""in many ways the different drm systems are akin to the different physical formats, such as betamax and vhs, that consumers have seen in the past,"" said ian fogg, personal technology and broadband analyst at jupiter research. ""the difference is that it is very fragmented,"" he said. ""it's not a two-horse race, it's a five, six, seven or even eight-horse race"" mr fogg said consumers had to be very careful when buying digital content to ensure that it would play on the devices they own. he said currently there were even incompatibilities within drm families. although initiatives such as microsoft's ""plays for sure"" program could help remove some of the uncertainty, he said, life was likely to be confusing for consumers for some time to come.  shelley taylor, analyst and author of a report about online music services, said the locks and limits on digital files were done to maximise the cash that firms can make from consumers. apple's itunes service was a perfect example of this, she said. ""although itunes has been hugely successful, apple could not justify its existence if it did not help sell all those ipods,"" she said.  she said rampant competition between online music services, of which there are now 230 according to recent figures, could drive more openness and freer file formats. ""it always works out that consumer needs win out in the long run,"" she said, ""and the services that win in the long run are the ones that listen to consumers earliest."" ms taylor said the limits legal download services place on files could help explain the continuing popularity of file-sharing systems that let people get hold of pirated pop. ""people want portability,"" she said, ""and with peer-to-peer they have 100% portability."" cory doctorow, european co-ordinator for the electronic frontier foundation which campaigns for consumers on many cyber-rights issues, expressed doubts that the marlin system would achieve its aims. ""not one of these systems has ever prevented piracy or illegal copying,"" he said. he said many firms readily admit that their drm systems are little protection against skilled attackers such as the organised crime gangs that are responsible for most piracy. instead, said mr doctorow, drm systems were intended to control the group that electronics firms have most hold over - consumers. ""the studios and labels perceive an opportunity to sell you your media again and again - the ipod version, the auto version, the american and uk version, the ringtone version, and so on.""","instead, said mr doctorow, drm systems were intended to control the group that electronics firms have most hold over - consumers.by setting up the alliance to work on a common control system, the firms said they hope to end this current fragmentation of file formats.he said many firms readily admit that their drm systems are little protection against skilled attackers such as the organised crime gangs that are responsible for most piracy.shelley taylor, analyst and author of a report about online music services, said the locks and limits on digital files were done to maximise the cash that firms can make from consumers.""not one of these systems has ever prevented piracy or illegal copying,"" he said.in a joint statement the firms said they wanted to let consumers enjoy ""appropriately licensed video and music on any device, independent of how they originally obtained that content"".ms taylor said the limits legal download services place on files could help explain the continuing popularity of file-sharing systems that let people get hold of pirated pop.confusingly for consumers, the technology that comes out of the alliance will sit alongside the content control systems of rival firms such as microsoft and apple.""in many ways the different drm systems are akin to the different physical formats, such as betamax and vhs, that consumers have seen in the past,"" said ian fogg, personal technology and broadband analyst at jupiter research.the firms want to make a system that ensures files play on the hardware they make but also thwarts illegal copying.the move is widely seen as a way for the four firms to decide their own destiny on content control systems instead of having to sign up for those being pushed by apple and microsoft.the firms hope that it will also make it harder for consumers to make illegal copies of the music, movies and other digital content they have bought."
"go-ahead for balkan oil pipeline  albania, bulgaria and macedonia has given the go ahead for the construction of a $1.2bn oil pipeline that will pass through the balkan peninsula.  the project aims to allow alternative ports for the shipping of russian and caspian oil, that normally goes through turkish ports. it aims to transport 750,000 daily barrels of oil. the pipeline will be built by the us-registered albanian macedonian bulgarian oil corporation (ambo). the 912km pipeline will run from the bulgarian port of burgas, over the black sea to the albanian city of vlore on the adriatic coast, crossing macedonia.  the project was conceived in 1994 but it was delayed because of the lack of political support. by signing the agreement on tuesday, the prime ministers of bulgaria, albania and macedonia have overcome the problem. ""this is one of the most important infrastructure projects for regional, eu, and euro-atlantic integration for the western balkans,"" said albanian prime minister fatos nano. according to pat ferguson, president of ambo, work on the pipeline will begin in 2005 and it is expected to be ready in three or four years. he added that the company had already raised about $900m from the overseas private investment corporation (opic) - a us development agency - the eximbank and credit suisse first boston, among others. the project has also the support of the european union. analysts have said that oil companies like chevrontexaco, exxon mobil and british petroleum would be happy to find alternative routes to the bosphorus and dardanelles straits.","the pipeline will be built by the us-registered albanian macedonian bulgarian oil corporation (ambo).albania, bulgaria and macedonia has given the go ahead for the construction of a $1.2bn oil pipeline that will pass through the balkan peninsula.the project aims to allow alternative ports for the shipping of russian and caspian oil, that normally goes through turkish ports.the 912km pipeline will run from the bulgarian port of burgas, over the black sea to the albanian city of vlore on the adriatic coast, crossing macedonia.""this is one of the most important infrastructure projects for regional, eu, and euro-atlantic integration for the western balkans,"" said albanian prime minister fatos nano."
"yahoo moves into desktop search  internet giant yahoo has launched software to allow people to search e-mail and other files on their pcs.  the firm is following in the footsteps of microsoft, google and ask jeeves, which have offered similar services. search has become a lucrative and hotly-contested area of expansion for net firms, looking to extend loyalty beyond the web. with hard drives providing bigger storage, users could need more help to locate important files, such as photos.  the desktop search technology has been licensed from a us-based firm x1 technologies. it is designed to work alongside microsoft's outlook and outlook express e-mail programs. searching e-mail effectively is becoming increasingly important, especially as the amount of spam increases. according to research from message analysts the radicati group, up to 45% of businesses' critical information is stored in e-mail and attachments. yahoo's software can also work separately on the desktop, searching for music, photos and other files. users can search under a variety of criteria, including file name, size, date and time. it doesn't yet incorporate web searching, although yahoo has promised that future versions will allow users to search both web-based and desktop data. ""we are all getting more and more files on our desktop but the real commercial opportunity lies with linking this through to web content,"" said julian smith, an analyst with research firm jupiter.

"act on detention ruling, uk urged  the government must act quickly on the law lords' ruling that detention of foreign terror suspects without trial is unlawful, mary robinson has said.  the former un commissioner for human rights and irish president told radio 4's today the government's response would be scrutinised internationally. ""it would be very troubling if the government did not accept the judgement and then work within it,"" she said. home secretary charles clarke has said detainees will not be freed at present. speaking to parliament on his first day in office as home secretary following david blunkett's resignation, mr clarke said: ""i will be asking parliament to renew this legislation in the new year. ""in the meantime, we will be studying the judgement carefully to see whether it is possible to modify our legislation to address the concerns raised by the house of lords.""  mrs robinson said the law lords' ruling was ""in line with international legal opinion"" and praised their ""very decisive"" eight to one majority. ""what the law lords did was acknowledge the role of the government, but say that there had been a disproportionate use, that it amounted to executive detention and it was discriminatory because it didn't apply to british citizens,"" she said.  mrs robinson warned that a lack of action by the british government could lead to further action in legal arenas such as the european court of human rights in strasbourg. ""if the government were not to accept this ruling then there is further redress, including possible damages for the individuals who could claim that the government either was tardy or was resisting the implications of the judgement of the law lords."" she said a meeting of the club of madrid - a group of former world leaders - to be held in the spanish capital on the march anniversary of the train bombings there would probably discuss the ruling and its implications.

"tv show unites angolan families  angolan families who are attempting to track each other down, after being separated by nearly 30 years of war, are succeeding thanks to a hugely popular tv show.  meeting point has become one of tv angola's most watched programmes, and has reunited hundreds of families. it runs daily, not only on the television but also on the radio. every friday, hundreds of people gather in luanda's independence square to record a message in front of the tv cameras, in the hope that a lost relative will see it. many relatives have been reunited on air. ""at the beginning there was an absolute explosion - huge, huge crowds,"" sergio gera, the programme's chief co-ordinator, told bbc world service's assignment programme.

"gadget growth fuels eco concerns  technology firms and gadget lovers are being urged to think more about the environment when buying and disposing of the latest hi-tech products.  at the consumer electronics show in las vegas earlier this month, several hi-tech firms were recognised for their strategies to help the environment. ebay also announced the rethink project bringing together intel, apple, and ibm among others to promote recycling. the us consumer electronics market is set to grow by over 11% in 2005. but more awareness is needed about how and where old gadgets can be recycled as well as how to be more energy efficient, said the us environmental protection agency (epa). of particular growing concern is how much energy it takes to recharge portable devices, one of the fastest growing markets in technology. the consumer electronics association (cea) has predicted that shipments of consumer technologies in 2005 will reach more than $125.73 billion (nearly £68 billion).  ebay's initiative pulls together major technology firms, environment groups, government agencies and ebay users to give information about what to do with old computers and where to send them. the online auction house thinks that its already-established community of loyal users could be influential. ""we really became aware of the e-waste issue and we saw that our 125 million users can be a powerful force for good,"" ebay's david stern told the bbc news website.  ""we saw the opportunity to meet the additional demand we have on the site for used computers and saw the opportunity too to good some good for the environment."" but it is not just computers that cause a problem for the environment. teenagers get a new mobile every 11 months, adults every 18 months and a 15 million handsets are replaced in total each year. yet, only 15% are actually recycled. this year, a predicted two billion people worldwide will own a mobile, according to a deloitte report. schemes in the us, like ripmobile, could help in targeting younger generations with recycling messages. the initiative, which was also launched at ces, rewards 10 to 28-year-olds for returning unused phones.

"mobiles rack up 20 years of use  mobile phones in the uk are celebrating their 20th anniversary this weekend.  britain's first mobile phone call was made across the vodafone network on 1 january 1985 by veteran comedian ernie wise. in the 20 years since that day, mobile phones have become an integral part of modern life and now almost 90% of britons own a handset. mobiles have become so popular that many people use their handset as their only phone and rarely use a landline.  the first ever call over a portable phone was made in 1973 in new york but it took 10 years for the first commercial mobile service to be launched. the uk was not far behind the rest of the world in setting up networks in 1985 that let people make calls while they walked. the first call was made from st katherine's dock to vodafone's head office in newbury which at the time was over a curry house. for the first nine days of 1985 vodafone was the only firm with a mobile network in the uk. then on 10 january cellnet (now o2) launched its service. mike caudwell, spokesman for vodafone, said that when phones were launched they were the size of a briefcase, cost about £2,000 and had a battery life of little more than 20 minutes.  ""despite that they were hugely popular in the mid-80s,"" he said. ""they became a yuppy must-have and a status symbol among young wealthy business folk."" this was also despite the fact that the phones used analogue radio signals to communicate which made them very easy to eavesdrop on. he said it took vodafone almost nine years to rack up its first million customers but only 18 months to get the second million. ""it's very easy to forget that in 1983 when we put the bid document in we were forecasting that the total market would be two million people,"" he said.

"tories reject rethink on axed mp  sacked mp howard flight's local conservative association has insisted he will not be its candidate at the general election.  russell tanguay, agent for arundel and south downs tories, said mr flight was ineligible to be a candidate and the association was seeking a substitute. the news comes despite mr flight's allies saying they had enough support to hold a meeting to discuss his fate. mr flight landed in trouble over remarks on tory tax and spending plans. he quit as tory deputy chairman after apparently suggesting the tories planned extra spending cuts - but he wants to continue as an mp.  tory headquarters says he cannot stand as a conservative candidate because he is no longer an approved candidate. mr tanguay backed that view on tuesday, saying: ""howard flight is ineligible to stand as a conservative party candidate. ""the association is in the process of selecting a new candidate.""  but the local tory chairman made similar comments on friday and dissent continues. two local councillors who back mr flight met mr tanguay and the local association's chairman in arundel on tuesday afternoon but did not comment as they left the meeting. mr flight says he will not stand down as a candidate unless his local party instructs him to do so at an extraordinary general meeting (egm). the mp, who is consulting his lawyers, told bbc news: ""they selected me and they, if you like, dispose of me or keep me."" mr flight's supporters also say they have the 50 signatures needed to trigger the egm.  at a news conference, mr howard insisted he had played by the party's rules. the tory leader, who argues he is ensuring honesty, said: ""we do not say one thing in private and another thing in public.""  labour election campaign coordinator alan milburn said the tories were in ""turmoil"" because mr flight had exposed their hidden plans. the comments were not a ""one-off"", he said, claiming mr howard and other senior tories were obsessively committed to cutting public spending. liberal democrat chairman matthew taylor said: ""whilst i disagree with howard flight's views, it seems extraordinary to sack somebody for telling the truth.""  it has also emerged mr howard has suspended slough's constituency conservative association for refusing to deselect its candidate. adrian hilton was abandoned after suggesting the signing of the maastricht treaty, under john major's government, was an act of treason. the catholic herald also highlighted articles he wrote about the role of catholicism in the european union. mr hilton was chosen to fight the seat after the previous candidate, robert oulds, was sacked for being pictured with a range of guns and a hunting knife. slough conservative association has now been placed on ""support status"" and is being run from conservative campaign headquarters, says a senior party spokesman.  mr hilton on tuesday said he was considering taking legal action against his deposal. he said the local party had only learned of the final decision on the bbc news website on monday evening. ""there are people at central office who are behaving like little dictators and seemingly people who are ordinary members are being treated with contempt,"" he said. the party says it did try to contact the local conservative chairman.","mr flight says he will not stand down as a candidate unless his local party instructs him to do so at an extraordinary general meeting (egm).mr tanguay backed that view on tuesday, saying: ""howard flight is ineligible to stand as a conservative party candidate.russell tanguay, agent for arundel and south downs tories, said mr flight was ineligible to be a candidate and the association was seeking a substitute.sacked mp howard flight's local conservative association has insisted he will not be its candidate at the general election.two local councillors who back mr flight met mr tanguay and the local association's chairman in arundel on tuesday afternoon but did not comment as they left the meeting.it has also emerged mr howard has suspended slough's constituency conservative association for refusing to deselect its candidate.the comments were not a ""one-off"", he said, claiming mr howard and other senior tories were obsessively committed to cutting public spending.tory headquarters says he cannot stand as a conservative candidate because he is no longer an approved candidate.the party says it did try to contact the local conservative chairman.mr hilton on tuesday said he was considering taking legal action against his deposal.mr flight's supporters also say they have the 50 signatures needed to trigger the egm."
"spain coach faces racism inquiry  spain's football federation has initiated disciplinary action against national coach luis aragones over racist comments about thierry henry.  if found guilty aragones could lose his job or face a fine of about £22,000. the federation had initially declined to take action against aragones after comments he made during a national team training session in october. but its president angel maria villar changed his mind after a request by spain's anti-violence commission. aragones insisted the comments, made to henry's arsenal club-mate jose antonio reyes, were meant to motivate the player, and were not intended to be offensive.  ""i never intended to offend anyone, and for that reason i have a very easy conscience,"" he said at the time. ""i'm obliged to motivate my players to get the best results. ""as part of that job, i use colloquial language, with which we can all understand each other within the framework of the football world. "" england's players made a point of wearing anti-racism t-shirts when training before their friendly against spain in madrid last month.  but the storm increased following racist chanting by spanish fans at england's black players during the game, which spain won 1-0. spain's minister of sport jaime lissavetzky was quick to give his backing to the federation's decision. ""everyone who has a public function has to consider their declarations, and make sure they do not give a negative image,"" he said.

"be careful how you code  a new european directive could put software writers at risk of legal action, warns former programmer and technology analyst bill thompson.  if it gets its way, the dutch government will conclude its presidency of the european union by pushing through a controversial measure that has been rejected by the european parliament, lacks majority support from national governments and will leave millions of european citizens in legal limbo and facing the possibility of court cases against them. if the new law was about border controls, defence or even the new constitution, then our tv screens would be full of experts agonising over the impact on our daily lives. sadly for those who will be directly affected, the controversy concerns the patenting of computer programs, a topic that may excite the bloggers, campaigning groups and technical press but does not obsess middle britain. after all, how much fuss can you generate about the directive on the patentability of computer-implemented inventions, and the way it amends article 52 of the 1973 european patent convention? yet if the new directive is nodded through at the next meeting of one of the eu's ministerial councils, as seems likely, it will allow programs to be patented in europe just as they are in the us. many observers of the computing scene, including myself, think the results will be disastrous for small companies, innovative programmers and the free and open source software movement. it will let large companies patent all sorts of ideas and give legal force to those who want to limit their competitors' use of really obvious ideas.  in the us you cannot build a system that stores customer credit card details so that they can pay without having to re-enter them unless amazon lets you, because they hold the patent on ""one-click"" online purchase. it is a small invention, but amazon made it to the patent office first and now owns it.  we are relatively free from this sort of thing over here, but perhaps not for long. the new proposals go back to 2002, although argument about patentability of software and computer-implemented inventions has been going on since at least the mid-1980s. they have come to a head now after a year in which proposals were made, endorsed by the council of ministers, radically modified by the european parliament and then re-presented in their original form. some national governments seem to be aware of the problems. poland has rejected the proposal and germany's main political parties have opposed it, but there is not enough opposition to guarantee their rejection. early in december the british government held a consultation meeting with those who had commented on the proposals. science minister lord sainsbury went along to listen and outline the uk position, but according to those present, it was embarrassing to see how little the minister and his officials actually understood the issues concerned.  the draft directive is being put through the council as what is called an ""a"" item and can only be approved or rejected. no discussion or amendment is allowed. so why should we be worried? first, there is the abuse of the democratic process involved in disregarding the views of the parliament and abandoning all of their carefully argued amendments. this goes to the heart of the european project, and even those who do not care about software or patents should be worried. if coders are treated like this today, who is to say that it will not be you tomorrow?  more directly, once software patents are granted then any programmer will have to worry that the code they are writing is infringing someone else's patent. this is not about stealing software, as code is already protected by copyright. patents are not copyright, but something much stronger. a patent gives the owner the right to stop anyone else using their invention, even if the other person invented it separately. i have never, to my shame, managed to read lord byron's childe harold's pilgrimage. if it was pointed out that one of my articles contained a substantial chunk of the poem then i could defend myself in court by claiming that i had simply made it up and it was coincidence. the same does not hold for a patent. if i sit down this afternoon and write a brilliant graphics compression routine and it happens to be the same as the lzw algorithm used in gif files, then i am in trouble under patent law, at least in the us. coincidence is no defence. the proposed directive is supported by many of the major software companies, but this is hardly surprising since most of them are us-based and they have already had to cope with a legal environment that allows patents. they have legal departments and, more crucially, patents of their own which they can trade or cross-license with other patent holders.  even this system breaks down, of course, as microsoft found out last year when they initially lost a case brought by eolas which claimed that internet explorer (and other browsers) infringed an eolas patent. that one was eventually thrown out, but only after months of uncertainty and millions of dollars. but small companies, and the free and open software movement do not have any patents to trade. much of the really useful software we use every day, programs like the apache web server, the gnu/linux operating system and the fearsomely popular firefox browser, is developed outside company structures by people who do not have legal departments to check for patent infringements. the damage to software will not happen overnight, of course. if the directive goes through it has to be written into national laws and then there will be a steady stream of legal actions against small companies and open source products. eventually someone will decide to attack linux directly, probably with some secret funding from one or two large players. the new directive will limit innovation by forcing programmers to spend time checking for patent infringements or simply avoiding working in potentially competitive areas. and it will damage europe's computer industry. we can only hope that the council of ministers has the integrity and strength to reject this bad law.  bill thompson is a regular commentator on the bbc world service programme go digital.","this goes to the heart of the

"jones happy with henson heroics  wales fly-half stephen jones admitted he was happy to hand gavin henson responsibility for taking the match-winning kick against england.  jones had missed three earlier shots at goal when wales, 9-8 down, were awarded a long-range penalty with four minutes left in cardiff. ""i knew the percentages of gavin reaching it were far higher than me,"" jones said. ""when he said he wanted it, there were no problems."" jones had seen a long-range effort fall a whisker under the crossbar on the hour, before charlie hodgson put england in front with 10 minutes left. ""i looked at where it was and i knew i was going to struggle to make it,"" jones added. ""i said to gareth (thomas, the wales captain) 'this is touch and go.' it was out of my range and obviously gavin is phenomenal when it comes to distance. he was confident and fancied it. ""there were no questions that he'd miss it the way he was playing. he had a superb game."" jones was happy to hail henson's heroic contribution to wales' first win over england in cardiff since 1993. ""physically he's a specimen: he's a balanced player, he glides when he runs and obviously he's got a great kicking game as well,"" jones said.  ""his defence was superb, he made some great hits and he had a great game. ""i'm glad he's welsh."" victory over england for the first time since 1999 will no doubt fuel expectations of what wales might achieve in this year's six nations. but they now face three away fixtures in italy, france and scotland before completing their campaign against ireland in cardiff. ""people all over the world want to see wales back at the top table of world rugby,"" said a proud coach mike ruddock. ""but we are not there yet. the next step is finding the consistency to get further wins. ""we have to travel this week and we can't afford to get too giddy about this result. ""we have got to be professional and keep focused on facing italy.""  none more so than henson, who can now expect to have the same sort of spotlight thrust upon him as the likes of jonny wilkinson and brian o'driscoll. the confident 23-year-old is undaunted by the prospect of dealing with such weighty expectations however. ""i'm the sort of player who likes pressure on me,"" he said. ""it makes me more concentrated and i think i perform better under more pressure. ""i set a high standard against england and i've got to back it up next week.

"the sound of music is coming home  the original stage production of the sound of music is to be performed for the first time in the austrian capital, 40 years after the film was released.  the first full-scale theatrical production of the musical will make its debut in vienna on saturday. julie andrews starred in the 1965 film version of the rogers and hammerstein classic set in the alpine country. but despite being one of the most successful musicals of all time, it is barely known inside austria.  the film was never shown in any cinema in austria and was not broadcast on television until the early 1990s. the musical is based on the true story of the von trapp family who formed a singing troupe and escaped from nazi-occupied austria in 1938.  sensitivities about nazism during wartime austria and issues towards the von trapp family themselves could explain austria's reluctance to embrace the musical. another source of irritation for austrians is the song edelweiss, which is considered an traditional folk song by many filmgoers. the song was actually an invention by rodgers and hammerstein. many also consider the film to portray a kitsch image of austria, including yodelling, goat-herds and lederhosen. the production is being staged at a viennese opera house, the volksoper, beginning on saturday. maria, the novice nun who falls in love with baron von trapp, will be played by austro-australian actress and singer sandra pires.","the film was never shown in any cinema in austria and was not broadcast on television until the early 1990s.the musical is based on the true story of the von trapp family who formed a singing troupe and escaped from nazi-occupied austria in 1938.sensitivities about nazism during wartime austria and issues towards the von trapp family themselves could explain austria's reluctance to embrace the musical.the original stage production of the sound of music is to be performed for the first time in the austrian capital, 40 years after the film was released.the song was actually an invention by rodgers and hammerstein."
"us seeks new $280bn smoker ruling  the us justice department is to try to overturn a court ruling that threw out its claim for $280bn (£149bn) in damages from tobacco firms.  earlier this month, a three-judge appeal court panel rejected the claim - filed in 1999 by the administration of bill clinton - in a 2-1 decision. government lawyers said they would ask the full us court of appeals for the district of columbia to hear the case. the court room battle is seen as key in government attempts to fight smoking. ""it's pretty clear that they've suffered a severe setback,"" said anthony sebok, a professor at brooklyn law school, adding that the appeal was what the government ""would be expected to ask for"".  prosecutors had argued that tobacco firms lied about the dangers of smoking, ignored research that highlighted problems, looked to increase addiction by manipulating nicotine levels and targeted the young with their adverts. among the firms accused were altria group, rj reynolds tobacco, lorillard tobacco, liggett group and brown and williamson. prosecutors went after the companies using legislation put in place to fight organised crime, and accused the firms of conspiring and running ""racketeer influenced and corrupt organisations"". the tobacco companies denied the charges, saying that they never illegally conspired to promote smoking and fool the public. they also said that they have met many of the government's demands laid out in a landmark $206bn settlement hammered out in 1998 with 46 states. a three-judge panel agreed with the companies, finding that the case could not be brought under federal anti-racketeering laws.  central to the government's case was a meeting in the plaza hotel, new york, on 15 december, 1953. prosecutors contend that executives from the major tobacco firms met and agreed to present a unified strategy denying the harmful effects of smoking. despite denying for decades that smoking could be linked to illness, the companies have modified their stances in recent years. altria's philip morris now accepts that nicotine is harmful, and the company's main lawyer william ohlemeyer told the bbc last year that earlier statements may have been wrong but they were not dishonest. government lawyers have until 21 march to file their appeal.","government lawyers said they would ask the full us court of appeals for the district of columbia to hear the case.prosecutors contend that executives from the major tobacco firms met and agreed to present a unified strategy denying the harmful effects of smoking.the court room battle is seen as key in government attempts to fight smoking.prosecutors had argued that tobacco firms lied about the dangers of smoking, ignored research that highlighted problems, looked to increase addiction by manipulating nicotine levels and targeted the young with their adverts.government lawyers have until 21 march to file their appeal.the us justice department is to try to overturn a court ruling that threw out its claim for $280bn (£149bn) in damages from tobacco firms.the tobacco companies denied the charges, saying that they never illegally conspired to promote smoking and fool the public."
"hitachi unveils 'fastest robot'  japanese electronics firm hitachi has unveiled its first humanoid robot, called emiew, to challenge honda's asimo and sony's qrio robots.  hitachi said the 1.3m (4.2ft) emiew was the world's quickest-moving robot yet. two wheel-based emiews, pal and chum, introduced themselves to reporters at a press conference in japan. the robots will be guests at the world expo later this month. sony and honda have both built sophisticated robots to show off developments in electronics. explaining why hitachi's emiew used wheels instead of feet, toshihiko horiuchi, from hitachi's mechanical engineering research laboratory, said: ""we aimed to create a robot that could live and co-exist with people."" ""we want to make the robots useful for people ... if the robots moved slower than people, users would be frustrated."" emiew - excellent mobility and interactive existence as workmate - can move at 3.7m/h. its ""wheel feet"" resemble the bottom half of a segway scooter. with sensors on the head, waist, and near the wheels, pal and chum demonstrated how they could react to commands. ""i want to be able to walk about in places like shinjuku and shibuya [shopping districts] in the future without bumping into people and cars,"" pal told reporters. hitachi said pal and chum, which have a vocabulary of about 100 words, could be ""trained"" for practical office and factory use in as little as five to six years.  robotics researchers have long been challenged by developing robots that walk in the gait of a human. at the recent aaas (american association for the advancement of science) annual meeting in washington dc, researchers showed off bipedal designs. the three designs, each built by a different research group, use the same principle to achieve a human-like gait.  sony and honda have both used humanoid robots, which are not commercially available, as a way of showing off computing power and engineering expertise. honda's asimo was ""born"" five years ago. since then, honda and sony's qrio have tried to trump each other with what the robots can do at various technology events. asimo, has visited the uk, germany, the czech republic, france and ireland as part of a world tour. sony's qrio has been singing, jogging and dancing in formation around the world too and was, until last year, the fastest robot on two legs. but its record was beaten by asimo. it is capable of 3km/h, which its makers claim is almost four times as fast as qrio. last year, car maker toyota also stepped into the ring and unveiled its trumpet-playing humanoid robot. by 2007, it is predicted that there will be almost 2.5 million ""entertainment and leisure"" robots in homes, compared to about 137,000 currently, according to the united nations (un). by the end of that year, 4.1 million robots will be doing jobs in homes, said the report by the un economic commission for europe and the international federation of robotics. hitachi is one of the companies with home cleaning robot machines on the market.","japanese electronics firm hitachi has unveiled its first humanoid robot, called emiew, to challenge honda's asimo and sony's qrio robots.hitachi said the 1.3m (4.2ft) emiew was the world's quickest-moving robot yet.""we want to make the robots useful for people ...sony's qrio has been singing, jogging and dancing in formation around the world too and was, until last year, the fastest robot on two legs.explaining why hitachi's emiew used wheels instead of feet, toshihiko horiuchi, from hitachi's mechanical engineering research laboratory, said: ""we aimed to create a robot that could live and co-exist with people.""sony and honda have both built sophisticated robots to show off developments in electronics.since then, honda and sony's qrio have tried to trump each other with what the robots can do at various technology events.robotics researchers have long been challenged by developing robots that walk in the gait of a human.if the robots moved slower than people, users would be frustrated.""last year, car maker toyota also stepped into the ring and unveiled its trumpet-playing humanoid robot.the robots will be guests at the world expo later this month."
"web radio takes spanish rap global  spin the radio dial in the us and you are likely to find plenty of spanish-language music. but what you will not find is much spanish-language hip-hop.  hip-hop and rap are actually quite popular in the spanish-speaking world, but local artists are having trouble marketing their work abroad. but now, a us company is bringing rap and hip-hop en espanol to computer users everywhere. los caballeros de plan g are one of mexico's hottest hip-hop acts. they have a devoted fan base in their native monterrey. but most mexican hip-hop fans, not to mention fans in most of the spanish-speaking world, rarely get a chance to hear the group's tracks on the radio.  ""you can't really just go on the radio and listen to hip-hop in spanish... it's just not accessible,"" says manuel millan, a native of san diego, california. ""it's really hard for the spanish hip-hop scene to get into mainstream radio. you usually have a very commercialised sound and the groups are not really known around the country or around the world."" millan and two friends set out to change that - they wanted to make groups like los caballeros de plan g accessible to fans globally.  mainstream radio stations were not going to play this kind of music, and starting their own broadcast station was economically impossible. so, millan and his friends launched a website called latinohiphopradio.com. the name says it all: it is web-based radio, devoted to the hottest spanish language rap and hip-hop tracks. the site, which is in both in english and spanish, is meant to be easy to navigate. all the user has to do is download a media player. there are no djs. it is just music streamed over the net for free. suddenly, with the help of the website, los caballeros de plan g are producing ""export quality"" rap.  the web might be just the right medium for spanish language hip-hop right now. the genre is in what millan calls its ""infant stage"". but the production values are improving, and artists such as argentina's mustafa yoda are pushing to make it better and better. mustafa yoda is currently one of the hottest tracks on latinohiphopradio.com. ""he's considered the eminem of argentina, and the latin american hip-hop scene,"" millan says. ""he really hasn't had that much exposure as far as anywhere in the world, but he's definitely the one to look out for as far as becoming the next big thing in the spanish-speaking world."" currently, the chilean group makisa is also in latinohiphopradio.com's top 10, as is cuban artist papo record.

"monsanto fined $1.5m for bribery  the us agrochemical giant monsanto has agreed to pay a $1.5m (£799,000) fine for bribing an indonesian official.  monsanto admitted one of its employees paid the senior official two years ago in a bid to avoid environmental impact studies being conducted on its cotton. in addition to the penalty, monsanto also agreed to three years' close monitoring of its business practices by the american authorities. it said it accepted full responsibility for what it called improper activities.  a former senior manager at monsanto directed an indonesian consulting firm to give a $50,000 bribe to a high-level official in indonesia's environment ministry in 2002. the manager told the company to disguise an invoice for the bribe as ""consulting fees"".  monsanto was facing stiff opposition from activists and farmers who were campaigning against its plans to introduce genetically-modified cotton in indonesia. despite the bribe, the official did not authorise the waiving of the environmental study requirement. monsanto also has admitted to paying bribes to a number of other high-ranking officials between 1997 and 2002.  the chemicals-and-crops firm said it became aware of irregularities at a jakarta-based subsidiary in 2001 and launched an internal investigation before informing the us department of justice and the securities and exchange commission (sec). monsanto faced both criminal and civil charges from the department of justice and the sec.

"consumer spending lifts us growth  us economic growth accelerated in the third quarter, helped by strong consumer spending, official figures have shown.  the economy expanded at an annual rate of 3.7% in the july to september period, the commerce department said. the figure marked an increase on the 3.3% growth recorded in the second quarter, but fell short of the 4.2% rate pencilled in by forecasters. the increase reflected the biggest jump in consumer spending in a year. ""it was a little softer than the consensus, but not a real surprise,"" said gary thayer, an economist at ag edwards & sons. friday's growth estimate is one of the last significant pieces of economic data before the 2 november presidential election.  democrat challenger john kerry has criticised president george w bush's handling of the economy, pointing to a net loss of over 800,000 jobs since mr bush took office. analysts said the economy was still not growing fast enough to stimulate large-scale job creation. ""it's a pretty good growth rate, but it may not be good enough to create enough jobs,"" said robert brusca, chief economist at fact and opinion economics in new york. however, president bush is expected to point to commerce department figures showing that consumer spending grew at 4.6% in the third quarter, up from just 1.6% in the second, as evidence that his policies are generating solid growth. consumer spending accounts for about two thirds of all economic activity in the us.  the weaker than expected growth figure makes it less likely that the us federal reserve will raise interest rates next month, economists said.

"uk 'risks breaking golden rule'  the uk government will have to raise taxes or rein in spending if it wants to avoid breaking its ""golden rule"", a report suggests.  the rule states that the government can borrow cash only to invest, and not to finance its spending projects. the national institute of economic and social research (niesr) claims that taxes need to rise by about £10bn if state finances are to be put in order. the treasury said its plans were on track and funded until 2008. according to niesr, if the government's current economic cycle runs until march 2006 then it is ""unlikely"" the golden rule will be met. should the cycle end a year earlier, then the chances improve to ""50/50"". either way, fiscal tightening is needed, niesr said.  the report is the latest to call into question the viability of government spending projections. earlier this month, accountancy firm ernst & young said that chancellor of the exchequer gordon brown's forecasts for tax revenues were too optimistic.  it claimed revenues were likely to be £6bn below estimates by the end of the tax year despite the economy growing in line with forecasts. a treasury spokesperson dismissed the latest claims, saying it was ""on track to meeting spending rules and the golden rule in the current cycle and beyond"". ""spending plans have been set out until 2008 and they are fully affordable."" other than its warning on possible tax hikes, the niesr report was optimistic about the state of the uk and global economy.  it said the recent record-busting surge in oil prices would have a limited effect on worldwide expansion, saying that if anything the ""world economy will continue to grow strongly"". global gross domestic product (gdp) is tipped to be 4.1% this year, dipping to 4% in 2005, before picking up again to 4.2% in 2006. the us will continue to drive expansion until 2006, albeit at a slightly slower rate, as will be the case in japan. hinting at better times for uk exporters, niesr said the euro zone ""is expected to pick up speed"".  growth in britain also is set to accelerate, it forecast. ""despite weak growth in the third quarter, the forces sustaining the upswing remain intact and the economy will expand robustly in 2005 and 2006,"" niesr said, adding that ""the economy will become better balanced over the next two years as exports stage a recovery"". gdp is expected at 3.2% in 2004, and 2.8% in both 2005 and 2006. the main cloud on the horizon, niesr said, was the uk's much analysed and fretted over property market.","other than its warning on possible tax hikes, the niesr report was optimistic about the state of the uk and global economy.the uk government will have to raise taxes or rein in spending if it wants to avoid breaking its ""golden rule"", a report suggests.a treasury spokesperson dismissed the latest claims, saying it was ""on track to meeting spending rules and the golden rule in the current cycle and beyond"".hinting at better times for uk exporters, niesr said the euro zone ""is expected to pick up speed"".""despite weak growth in the third quarter, the forces sustaining the upswing remain intact and the economy will expand robustly in 2005 and 2006,"" niesr said, adding that ""the economy will become better balanced over the next two years as exports stage a recovery"".either way, fiscal tightening is needed, niesr said.according to niesr, if the government's current economic cycle runs until march 2006 then it is ""unlikely"" the golden rule will be met.the rule states that the government can borrow cash only to invest, and not to finance its spending projects.the treasury said its plans were on track and funded until 2008."
"iaaf to rule on greek sprint pair  greek sprinters kostas kenteris and katerina thanou are expected to find out on wednesday if they will be banned for missing drugs tests this summer.  the international association of athletics federations (iaaf) council held a conference call on tuesday and are set to announce their decision. kenteris and thanou could be suspended for up to two years. the duo withdrew from the olympics after missing a test but claimed they had suffered a motorcycle crash. the greek authorities have also brought criminal charges against the sprinters for avoiding a drugs test and faking an accident. their former coach christos tzekos is also facing charges and all three are awaiting a trial date.  however, the iaaf will determine the sprinters' future on the track after carefully considering all the evidence. the sport's ruling body is expected to direct the greek federation in what action it should take against the sprinters. kenteris and thanou can appeal against any decision at the court of arbitration for sport. the sprinters both sent written explanations to the iaaf, which have been taken into account. the iaaf sent an official warning to the sprinters and coach tzekos after they were discovered training in qatar rather than in crete, where they had said they would be. but kenteris and thanou then went on to skip tests in tel aviv and chicago, when they decided to fly back to greece early. just before the olympics, the pair dramatically missed another test in athens before withdrawing from the games. kenteris, 31, won gold in the 200m at the sydney olympics in 2000, where thanou, 29, won silver in the 100m.","greek sprinters kostas kenteris and katerina thanou are expected to find out on wednesday if they will be banned for missing drugs tests this summer.kenteris, 31, won gold in the 200m at the sydney olympics in 2000, where thanou, 29, won silver in the 100m.the greek authorities have also brought criminal charges against the sprinters for avoiding a drugs test and faking an accident.but kenteris and thanou then went on to skip tests in tel aviv and chicago, when they decided to fly back to greece early.kenteris and thanou can appeal against any decision at the court of arbitration for sport.kenteris and thanou could be suspended for up to two years."

"ireland 17-12 south africa  ronan o'gara scored all ireland's points as the home side claimed only their second ever win over south africa on an emotional day at lansdowne road.  o'gara's first-half try, poached after a quick tap-penalty, helped the irish to a 8-3 lead at half-time. three further o'gara penalties extended ireland's lead to 17-6 as the game entered the final quarter. two percy montgomery penalties set up a frantic finish but ireland held out to claim a famous victory. ireland began strongly and were never led, but the match was tense and closely fought throughout. aware of the threat posed by the south africans, ireland pressed hard from the outset, and played some impressive rugby while searching for a breakthrough. early on, denis hickie thought he was in for a try after a delightful backline move but shane horgan's pass was adjudged to have gone forward by referee paul honiss.  ireland continued to press and they showed their intent by opting for a line-out in the 19th minute when three straight-forward points were on offer. another south african infringement a minute later led to ireland's first points - o'gara took a quick tap-penalty and charged over the opposition line for an irish try. the springboks could feel hard done by as captain john smit had his back to the play when o'gara pounced after referee honiss had told the skipper to warn his own players after consistent infringements. stung by the score, the south africans almost replied with a try of their own within 60 seconds with geordan murphy's ankle-tap tackle denying a certain try for percy montgomery. however, the springboks did win a penalty a minute later which montgomery easily slotted to cut ireland's lead to 5-3.  ireland got out of jail when the south africans had a three-to-one overlap near the irish line only to waste the chance. after the sustained springboks pressure, the irish produced an attack of their own in the 34th minute which culminated with o'gara's clever drop-goal to restore his side's lead to five points which remained the margin at half-time. sustained irish pressure immediately after half-time was rewarded by another o'gara penalty. however, montgomery responded quickly by slotting over a superb penalty from near the right touchline to cut ireland's lead to five points again. montgomery then burst through the irish defence in the 48th minute and it took a superb girvan dempsey tackle to prevent a try. the south africans suffered a double-blow in the 52nd minute when schalk burger was sin-binned for the second week in a row after killing the ball and o'gara punished the transgression by notching another penalty.  in the 61st minute, hickie was left frustrated by a poor pass from girvan dempsey as a chance to seal the match was wasted. however, a late tackle on brian o'driscoll enabled o'gara to notch another penalty in the 63rd minute which extended ireland's lead to 17-6. however, two montgomery penalties had ireland's lead in peril again as the springboks closed to within five points with seven minutes remaining. south africa produced a huge effort in the closing minutes but ireland held on to claim a deserved victory.  g dempsey;

"public show for reynolds portrait  sir joshua reynolds' portrait of omai will get a public airing following fears it would stay hidden because of an export wrangle.  the tate gallery unsuccessfully tried to buy the picture from its anonymous owner after a ban was issued preventing the painting from leaving the uk. the 18th century painting has remained in storage but the owner has agreed to allow it to be part of an exhibition. the exhibition of reynolds' work will be shown at tate britain from may. joshua reynolds: the creation of celebrity will feature prints, caricatures, and sculpture by the 18th century artist, who painted some of the most famous personalities of his day. portrait of omai fetched the second highest amount for a british painting when it was sold at auction for £10.3m in 2001. it was bought by a london dealer who sold it on to a collector. the unnamed collector wanted to take it out of the country, but was barred from doing so by the government because of its historical significance.  in march 2004, the tate managed to raise £12.5m funding to buy the portrait but the owner refused to sell and it has been held in storage since. the portrait is of a young man who was dubbed ""the noble savage"" when he arrived in london from polynesia. he became a darling of london society and was invited to all the best parties by people who were fascinated by such an exotic character. sir joshua painted him after his arrival in 1774, and it became the artist's most famous work after it was first exhibited at the royal academy in 1776.","it was bought by a london dealer who sold it on to a collector.portrait of omai fetched the second highest amount for a british painting when it was sold at auction for £10.3m in 2001.sir joshua painted him after his arrival in 1774, and it became the artist's most famous work after it was first exhibited at the royal academy in 1776.the portrait is of a young man who was dubbed ""the noble savage"" when he arrived in london from polynesia.the tate gallery unsuccessfully tried to buy the picture from its anonymous owner after a ban was issued preventing the painting from leaving the uk."

"broadband in the uk growing fast  high-speed net connections in the uk are proving more popular than ever.  bt reports that more people signed up for broadband in the last three months than in any other quarter. the 600,000 connections take the total number of people in the uk signing up for broadband from bt to almost 3.3 million. nationally more than 5 million browse the net via broadband. britain now has among the highest number of broadband connections throughout the whole of europe.  according to figures gathered by industry watchdog, ofcom, the growth means that the uk has now surpassed germany in terms of broadband users per 100 people. the uk total of 5.3 million translates into 7.5 connections per 100 people, compared to 6.7 in germany and 15.8 in the netherlands. the numbers of people signing up to broadband include those that get their service direct from bt or via the many companies that re-sell bt lines under their own name. part of the surge in people signing up was due to bt stretching the reach of adsl - the uk's most widely used way of getting broadband - beyond 6km.  asymmetric digital subscriber line technology lets ordinary copper phone lines support high data speeds. the standard speed is 512kbps, though faster connections are available. ""this breakthrough led to a dramatic increase in orders as we were suddenly able to satisfy the pent-up demand that existed in many areas,"" said paul reynolds, chief executive of bt wholesale which provides phone lines that other firms re-sell. bt retail, which sells net services under its own name, also had a good quarter and provided about 30% of the new broadband customers. this was a slight increase on the previous three months. despite the good news about growth in broadband, figures from telecommunications regulator ofcom show that bt faces increasing competition, and dwindling influence, in other sectors. local loop unbundling, (llu), in which bt rivals install their hardware in exchanges and take over the line to a customer's home or office, is growing steadily. cable & wireless and ntl have announced that they are investing millions to start offering llu services. by the end of september more than 4.2 million phone lines were using so-called carrier pre-section (cps) services, such as talktalk and one.tel, which route phone calls across non-bt networks from a local exchange. there are now more than 300 different firms offering cps services and the percentage of people using bt lines for voice calls has shrunk to 55.4%.","the 600,000 connections take the total number of people in the uk signing up for broadband from bt to almost 3.3 million.the numbers of people signing up to broadband include those that get their service direct from bt or via the many companies that re-sell bt lines under their own name.bt reports that more people signed up for broadband in the last three months than in any other quarter.there are now more than 300 different firms offering cps services and the percentage of people using bt lines for voice calls has shrunk to 55.4%.the uk total of 5.3 million translates into 7.5 connections per 100 people, compared to 6.7 in germany and 15.8 in the netherlands.bt retail, which sells net services under its own name, also had a good quarter and provided about 30% of the new broadband customers.part of the surge in people signing up was due to bt stretching the reach of adsl - the uk's most widely used way of getting broadband - beyond 6km.nationally more than 5 million browse the net via broadband."
"progress on new internet domains  by early 2005 the net could have two new domain names.  the .post and .travel net domains have been given preliminary approval by the net's administrative body. the names are just two of a total of 10 proposed domains that are being considered by the internet corporation for assigned names and numbers, icann. the other proposed names include a domain for pornography, asia, mobile phones, an anti-spam domain and one for the catalan language and culture.  the .post domain is backed by the universal postal union that wants to use it as the online marker for every type of postal service and to help co-ordinate the e-commerce efforts of national post offices.  the .travel domain would be used by hotels, travel firms, airlines, tourism offices and would help such organisations distinguish themselves online. it is backed by a new york-based trade group called the travel partnership. icann said its early decision on the two domains was in response to the detailed technical and commercial information the organisations behind the names had submitted. despite this initial approval, icann cautioned that there was no guarantee that the domains would actually go into service. at the same time icann is considering proposals for another eight domains. one that may not win approval is a proposal to set up a .xxx domain for pornographic websites. a similar proposal has been made many times in the past. but icann has been reluctant to approve it because of the difficulty of making pornographers sign up and use it. in 2000 icann approved seven other new domains that have had varying degrees of success. three of the new so-called top level domains were for specific industries or organisations such as .museum and .aero. others such as .info and .biz were intended to be more generic. in total there are in excess of 200 domain names and the majority of these are for nations. but domains that end in the .com suffix are by far the most numerous.","by early 2005 the net could have two new domain names.the names are just two of a total of 10 proposed domains that are being considered by the internet corporation for assigned names and numbers, icann.in 2000 icann approved seven other new domains that have had varying degrees of success.the other proposed names include a domain for pornography, asia, mobile phones, an anti-spam domain and one for the catalan language and culture.icann said its early decision on the two domains was in response to the detailed technical and commercial information the organisations behind the names had submitted.despite this initial approval, icann cautioned that there was no guarantee that the domains would actually go into service.in total there are in excess of 200 domain names and the majority of these are for nations.the .post and .travel net domains have been given preliminary approval by the net's administrative body."
"putin backs state grab for yukos  russia's president has defended the purchase of yukos' key production unit by state-owned oil firm rosneft, saying it followed free market principles.  vladimir putin said it was quite within the rights of a state-owned company to ensure its interests were met. rosneft bought 100% of baikal finance group, in a move that amounts to the renationalisation of a major chunk of russia's booming oil industry. rosneft will now control about 16% of russia's total crude oil output. yukos share jumped in moscow, climbing as much as 50% before being suspended.  rosneft is already in the process of merging with gazprom, the world's biggest gas company, a move that will see gazprom return to majority state-ownership.  baikal was the surprise buyer of oil and gas giant yukos's main production division at a forced auction on sunday. ""everything was done by market methods,"" mr putin said at his year-end press conference in moscow. shedding some light on the kremlin's motivation, mr putin referred to a period of so-called ""cowboy capitalism"" that followed the collapse of the soviet union.  he said privatisations carried out in the early 1990s had involved trickery, including law breaking, by people seeking to acquire valuable state property. ""now the state, using market methods, is safeguarding its interests. i think this is quite normal,"" the russian president said. a rosneft spokesman has said the acquisition is part of its plan to build a ""balanced, national energy corporation.""  the latest announcement comes after more than a year of wrangling that has pushed yukos, one of russia's biggest companies to the brink of collapse. the russian government put yukos's yuganskneftegas subsidiary up for sale last week after hitting the company with a $27bn (£14bn) bill for back taxes and fines.  analysts say that yukos's legal attempts to block the auction by filing for bankruptcy protection in the us are probably what caused this week's cloak-and-dagger dealings. gazprom, the company originally tipped to buy yuganskneftegas, was banned from taking part in the auction by a us court injunction. by selling the yukos unit to little-known baikal and then to rosneft, russia is able to circumvent a host of tricky legal landmines, analysts said. ""you cannot sue the russian government,"" said eric kraus, a strategist at moscow's sovlink securities. ""the russian government has sovereign immunity."" ""the government is renationalising yuganskneftegas.""  even so, analysts reckon that the saga still has a long way to go. the rosneft announcement came just hours after yukos accused gazprom of illegally taking part in sunday's auction. it has said it will be seeking damages of $20bn. the claim was made at the latest hearing in the us bankruptcy court in houston, texas, where yukos, had filed for chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. if found in contempt of the us court order blocking the auction, gazprom could face having foreign assets seized. yukos' lawyers had also been expected to try to have baikal's assets frozen. lawyers claimed the auction was illegal because yukos - with an office in houston - had filed for bankruptcy and therefore its assets were under the protection of us law which has worldwide jurisdiction. further muddying the waters is a merger between rosneft and gazprom which authorities have said will go ahead as planned.","lawyers claimed the auction was illegal because yukos - with an office in houston - had filed for bankruptcy and therefore its assets were under the protection of us law which has worldwide jurisdiction.russia's president has defended the purchase of yukos' key production unit by state-owned oil firm rosneft, saying it followed free market principles.it has said it will be seeking damages of $20bn.the rosneft announcement came just hours after yukos accused gazprom of illegally taking part in sunday's auction.gazprom, the company originally tipped to buy yuganskneftegas, was banned from taking part in the auction by a us court injunction.by selling the yukos unit to little-known baikal and then to rosneft, russia is able to circumvent a host of tricky legal landmines, analysts said.a rosneft spokesman has said the acquisition is part of its plan to build a ""balanced, national energy corporation.""further muddying the waters is a merger between rosneft and gazprom which authorities have said will go ahead as planned.""everything was done by market methods,"" mr putin said at his year-end press conference in moscow.the latest announcement comes after more than a year of wrangling that has pushed yukos, one of russia's biggest companies to the brink of collapse.vladimir putin said it was quite within the rights of a state-owned company to ensure its interests were met.""the russian government has sovereign immunity."""

"turkey knocks six zeros off lira  turkey is to relaunch its currency on saturday, knocking six zeros off the lira in the hope of boosting trade and powering its growing economy.  the change will see the end of such dizzyingly-high denominations as five million lira - enough for a short taxi ride - and the 20m note, worth $15. these valuations were the product of decades of inflation which, as recently as 2001, was as high as 70%. inflation has since been tamed and economic prospects are improving.  the currency - officially to be known as the new lira - will be launched at midnight on 1 january. from that point, the one-million lira note will become the new one-lira coin. the government hopes the change will be seen as a promise of growing economic stability as turkey embarks on the long process of trying to join the european union.  on an everyday level, it is hoped the change will stimulate more international trade and end confusion among foreign investors and turks alike. ""the transition to the new turkish lira shows clearly that our economy has broken the vicious circle that it was imprisoned in for long years,"" said sureyya serdengecti, head of the turkish central bank. ""the new lira is also the symbol of the stable economy that we dreamed of for long years.""  the turkish economy teetered on the brink of collapse in 2001 when the lira plunged in value and two million people lost their jobs.  turkey had to turn to the international monetary fund for financial assistance, accepting a $18bn loan in return for pushing through a wide-ranging austerity programme. these tough measures have borne fruit. inflation fell below 10% earlier this year for the first time in decades while exports are up 30% this year. meanwhile, the economy is expanding at a healthy rate, with 7.9% growth expected in 2004. the government hopes that the new currency will cement the country's economic progress, two weeks after eu leaders set a date for the start of turkey's accession talks.  the slimmed-down lira is likely to be widely welcomed by the business community.  ""the turkish lira has been like funny money,"" tevfik aksoy, chief turkish economist for deutsche bank, told associated press.

""the fsa should not bide their time and 'wait and see'. they should seize the moment,"" mr prettejohn, lloyd's chief executive said. the fsa took over regulation of the general insurance sector in january, but it sidestepped calls to require brokers to disclose the commissions they earn from insurers to their clients. last week, the city watchdog gave brokers and insurers guidance on managing conflicts of interest. brokers must give information on their commissions if, and only if, their customers request it, the fsa said.  in the us, lack of transparency about brokers' commissions has led to problems. the world's biggest insurance broker marsh & mclennan said last week it would pay $850m to settle charges, raised by new york attorney general eliot spitzer in october, that it sought to rig bids in conjunction with insurers. the probe centred around so-called contingent commissions, whereby brokers were rewarded according to how much business they brought to an insurer, an arrangement that did not always benefit brokers' customers. all of the insurance business written in the lloyd's market is placed via brokers.","the fsa took over regulation of the general insurance sector in january, but it sidestepped calls to require brokers to disclose the commissions they earn from insurers to their clients.in a speech on monday, mr prettejohn urged the fsa to force brokers to disclose the size of their commissions.brokers must give information on their commissions if, and only if, their customers request it, the fsa said.the head of lloyd's of london, the insurance market, has criticised britain's financial watchdog, the financial services authority (fsa).all of the insurance business written in the lloyd's market is placed via brokers.""the fsa should change, and change now"" said mr prettejohn, who wants it to move from ""disclosure on request"" to mandatory disclosure."
"o'connor aims to grab opportunity  johnny o'connor is determined to make a big impression when he makes his rbs six nations debut for ireland against scotland on saturday.  the wasps flanker replaces denis leamy but o'connor knows that the munster man will be pushing hard for a recall for the following game against england.

"market unfazed by aurora setback  as the aurora limped back to its dock on 20 january, a blizzard of photos and interviews seemed to add up to an unambiguous tale of woe.  the ship had another slice of bad luck to add to its history of health scares and technical trouble. and its owner, p&o cruises - now part of the huge us carnival corporation - was looking at a significant slice chopped off this year's profits and a potential pr fiasco. no-one, however, seems to have told the stock markets. the warning of a five-cent hit to 2005 earnings came just 24 hours after one of the world's biggest investment banks had upped its target for carnival's share price, from £35 to £36.20. other investors barely blinked, and by 1300 gmt carnival's shares in london were down a single penny, or 0.03%, at £32.26.  why the mismatch between the public perception and the market's response? ""the aurora issue had been an ongoing one for some time,"" says deutsche bank's simon champion. ""it was clearly a source of uncertainty for the company - it was a long cruise, after all. but the stock market is very good at treating these issues as one-off events.""  despite its string of bad luck, he pointed out, aurora is just one vessel in a large carnival fleet, the uk's p&o princess group having been merged into the much larger us firm in 2003. and generally speaking, carnival has a reputation for keeping its ships pretty much on schedule. ""carnival has an incredibly strong track record,"" mr champion.  similarly, analysts expect the impact on the rest of the cruise business to be limited. the hundreds of disappointed passengers who have now had to give up the opportunity to spend the next three months on the aurora have got both a refund and a credit for another cruise. that should mitigate some of the pr risk, both for carnival and its main competitor, royal caribbean. ""while not common, cancellations for technical reasons are not entirely unusual in the industry,"" wrote analysts from citigroup smith barney in a note to clients on friday. ""moreover, such events typically have a limited impact on bookings and pricing for future cruises."" after all, the aurora incident may be big news in the uk - but for carnival customers elsewhere it's unlikely to make too much of a splash.  assuming that citigroup is right, and demand stays solid, the structure of the industry also works in carnival's favour. in the wake of p&o princess's takeover by carnival, the business is now to a great extent a duopoly. given the expense of building, outfitting and running a cruise ship, ""slowing supply growth"" is a certainty, said david anders at merrill lynch on thursday. in other words, if you do want a cruise, your options are limited. and with carnival remaining the market leader, it looks set to keep selling the tickets - no matter what happens to the ill-fated aurora in the future.","despite its string of bad luck, he pointed out, aurora is just one vessel in a large carnival fleet, the uk's p&o princess group having been merged into the much larger us firm in 2003.and with carnival remaining the market leader, it looks set to keep selling the tickets - no matter what happens to the ill-fated aurora in the future.similarly, analysts expect the impact on the rest of the cruise business to be limited.after all, the aurora incident may be big news in the uk - but for carnival customers elsewhere it's unlikely to make too much of a splash.and generally speaking, carnival has a reputation for keeping its ships pretty much on schedule.and its owner, p&o cruises - now part of the huge us carnival corporation - was looking at a significant slice chopped off this year's profits and a potential pr fiasco.in the wake of p&o princess's takeover by carnival, the business is now to a great extent a duopoly.""the aurora issue had been an ongoing one for some time,"" says deutsche bank's simon champion.""carnival has an incredibly strong track record,"" mr champion.in other words, if you do want a cruise, your options are limited."

"domain system opens door to scams  a system to make it easier to create website addresses using alphabets like cyrillic could open a back door for scammers, a trade body has warned.  the internationalised domain names system has been a work in progress for years and has recently been approved by the internet engineering task force. but the uk internet forum (ukif) is concerned that the system will let scammers create fake sites more easily. the problem lies in the computer codes used to represent language.  registering names that look like that of legitimate companies but lead users to fake sites designed to steal passwords and credit card details could become a whole lot easier for determined scammers, says stephen dyer, director of ukif. domain names are the ""real language"" addresses of websites, rather than their internet protocol address, which is a series of numbers. they are used so people can more easily navigate the web. so-called ascii codes are used to represent european languages but for other languages a hybrid of a system called unicode is used. so, for example, website paypal could now be coded using a mixture of the latin alphabet and the russian alphabet. the resulting domain as displayed to the users would look identical to the real site as a russian 'a' look just like an english 'a'. but the computer code would be different, and the site it would lead users to could be a fake. this is more than just a theory. a fake paypal.com has already been registered with net domain giant verisign by someone who has followed the debate around the internationalised domain name (idn) system, said mr dyer. as the idea was to prove a point rather than be malicious the fake domain has now been handed back to paypal but it sets a worrying precedent, mr dyer said. ""although the idn problem is well known in technical circles, the commercial world is totally unaware how easily their websites can be faked,"" said mr dyer.  ""it is important to alert users that there is a new and invisible and almost undetectable way of diverting them to what looks like a perfectly genuine site,"" he added. there are solutions. for instance, browsers could spot domains that use mixed characters and display them in different colours as a warning to users. mr dyer acknowledged that it would be a huge undertaking to update all the world's browsers. another solution, to introduce idn-disabled browsers could be a case of ""throwing out the baby with the bath water,"" he said. centr, the council of european national top level domain registries, agrees. ""a rush to introduce idn-disabled browsers into the marketplace is an overly-zealous step that will harm public confidence in idns - a technology that is desperately needed in the non-english speaking world,"" the organisation said in a statement.","a fake paypal.com has already been registered with net domain giant verisign by someone who has followed the debate around the internationalised domain name (idn) system, said mr dyer.but the computer code would be different, and the site it would lead users to could be a fake.as the idea was to prove a point rather than be malicious the fake domain has now been handed back to paypal but it sets a worrying precedent, mr dyer said.the resulting domain as displayed to the users would look identical to the real site as a russian 'a' look just like an english 'a'.a system to make it easier to create website addresses using alphabets like cyrillic could open a back door for scammers, a trade body has warned.registering names that look like that of legitimate companies but lead users to fake sites designed to steal passwords and credit card details could become a whole lot easier for determined scammers, says stephen dyer, director of ukif.so-called ascii codes are used to represent european languages but for other languages a hybrid of a system called unicode is used.but the uk internet forum (ukif) is concerned that the system will let scammers create fake sites more easily.the internationalised domain names system has been a work in progress for years and has recently been approved by the internet engineering task force."

"blair and brown criticised by mps  labour mps have angrily criticised tony blair and gordon brown amid renewed reports of a rift between the two men.  a meeting of the parliamentary labour party saw a succession of normally loyal members warn that feuding could jeopardise labour's election hopes. the pm insisted nothing would derail labour's campaign, despite a new book saying he has upset his chancellor by backing out of a pledge to stand aside. mr brown will again be in the public eye at the party's new poster launch. in what the party had hoped would be perceived as a show of unity, he is due to line up alongside alan milburn - the man controversially appointed as the party's election supremo - and deputy leader john prescott for the event in london on tuesday. relations between mr brown and mr milburn are widely reported to be cool ever since mr blair brought the latter back into the cabinet to run labour's election campaign, a role successfully carried out by mr brown in both 1997 and 2001.  mr blair told the parliamentary labour party on monday: ""i know from everyone here, in cabinet and government, nothing is going to get in the way of a unified labour party with a unified position and winning the third term people desperately need.""  the prime minister and his chancellor arrived within seconds of each other for the meeting of the plp and were seemingly in good spirits as it started. new speculation about the state of their relationship was sparked by claims in brown's britain, by sunday telegraph journalist robert peston, which suggested mr blair went back on a pledge to make way for mr brown. labour's paul flynn said mr blair and mr brown had a ""scorching"" from mps adding: ""it was a parliamentary labour party meeting like no other.""  backbencher stephen pound said some mps had threatend to expose those fuelling the reports if mr blair and mr brown did not ""stop this nonsense, this poisonous briefing"". lord campbell-savours, a former mp, challenged mr brown to deny reports that he had told the prime minister he did not believe anything he said. mr prescott said mps were entitled to complain about discipline after reading recent press reports.

"minimum wage increased to £5.05  the minimum wage will rise in october, benefiting more than 1m people, the government has announced.  adults must be paid at least £5.05 an hour, up from £4.85, while 18 to 21 year olds will be paid £4.25. the recommendations came from the low pay commission which said the number of jobs had continued to grow since the minimum wage was introduced in 1999. businesses wanted it frozen, warning more rises could damage competitiveness but the unions want a £6 rate.  a further increase in the adult rate to £5.35 an hour is provisionally scheduled for october 2006. according to the commission, many businesses had found the last two significant increases in the minimum wage ""challenging"". ""we have therefore recommended only a slight increase above average earnings, and concentrated it in the second year to allow business more time to absorb the impact,"" said chairman adair turner. the government says most of those on the minimum wage are women - with many working in cleaning, catering, shops and hairdressing.  unveiling the latest increase, mr blair said he wanted the minimum wage to become a ""symbol of decency and fairness"". ""for too long, poverty pay capped the aspiration and prosperity of far too many hard-working families,"" he said. ""too often, people were told to make a choice between the indignity of unemployment or the humiliation of poverty pay."" chancellor gordon brown and transport secretary alistair darling promoted the news in edinburgh, wales secretary peter hain and welsh first minister rhodri morgan in cardiff and northern ireland minister john spellar in belfast. the government has not accepted the commission's recommendation that 21-year-olds should be paid at the adult rate, but says it will look again at the rate later on. mr brown said: ""we want to do nothing that can damage the employment opportunities for young people, particularly young people entering the labour market for the first time."" the government has said it will look at tougher action against the small number of employers who consistently refuse to pay the minimum wage.  the national minimum wage is currently set at £4.85 per hour for those aged 22 and above, and at £4.10 for those aged 18 to 21. a £3 per hour minimum wage was introduced last october for 16 to 17-year-olds, but apprentices are exempt. the trade unions congress welcomed the increase, but has called for a £6 minimum wage by next year. but the confederation of british industry (cbi) called for a ""pause year"" to assess the impact of the above inflation rise in the minimum wage in october. and david frost, director of the british chambers of commerce, said: ""the level of increase each year has increased by rates far outstripping the rates of inflation. ""what employers are saying to us now is that it's at a level where it's starting to bite into the competitiveness of companies right across the country.""  the liberal democrats' economics spokesman vincent cable said he supported the move to raise the minimum wage. ""it's not just good for the workers themselves but it lifts them out of benefits and therefore is good for the exchequer too,"" he said. conservative leader michael howard said he accepted the principle of the minimum wage and would not ""seek to disturb"" the increase. speaking on bbc radio 4's woman's hour, mr howard hinted the tories might go into the general election with a promise to cancel income tax for the lowest-paid workers. ""there are people on very low salaries, very low incomes indeed who really shouldn't be paying income tax,"" he said.  it would be better to decrease taxes on earnings below £12,000 a year, with say no tax on below £6,000. the losses in tax can be recouped by having a 50pc tax band for people making over £100,000. our minimum wage is going to be effectively almost twice the us minimum wage, yet our economy per person is only 2/3rds of the us! perhaps, we have to really starting questioning why some products cost 50-60% more here than they do in the us. this combined with the tax decreases would make the pounds the low-paid people do make go much further.  it's still not good enough! i got a part time job at 16 when i was doing my a-levels in an attempt to get a little money saved for uni. this was only 2 years ago and i was getting paid £2.75 an hour, and working as hard as any of the older staff, maybe it's about time 16 - 21 year olds got a fair wage!  we must remember that the minimum wage is only part of the picture and must not rise to a level that makes employing people unattractive and encourages businesses to send work and therefore jobs abroad. still government and local councils employ staff via their contractors that pay at the minimum wage or very close to it. an easy way for the government to do as it preaches would be to insist on floor pay levels for all government workers and take tens of thousand of civil servants out of the social security system all together.  any increase is certainly welcome news. however for all those whining about the pressures of an increase in the minimum wage i would simply ask them: ""would you be happy to work for less than £5.05 an hour?"". thought not ... so then, don't expect others to either.  i can't believe that so many of these comments are against the minimum wage! also i personally take great offence at the insinuation that people earning minimum wage were lazy at school if everyone went to university then who would serve you in the supermarkets and clean up after you? it's about time that these hardworking people are rewarded with only what they deserve and have earned fair pay and a bit of respect wouldn't go a miss either. br /&gt;  this is good news. the minimum wage has put a sense of equality back into a worker's relationship with their employer. wages are supposed to be a fair reflection of an employee's efforts. for too long wages were a point of exploitation - what could an employer get away with. in very simplistic terms this put a pressure to keep low-paid wages low. with the minimum wage this downward pressure is at least partly removed.  it is also interesting to read the comments from so called business leaders. they are the first to defend the rights and privileges of boards to award fat-cat salaries, bonuses and pension rights to the select few but they are the first to attack policies that are put in place to merely defend the rights of those that really make those fat cats purr!  i feel there are both negatives and positives to the increase, on one hand some businesses will struggle to stay afloat but on the other hand in today world many young people can't afford to move out as property costs too much and only by earning more will they be able to get on in life. its true many may get complacent but the minimum wage could be looked at as more of a stepping stone rather than a hand out.  here come the usual whines about how difficult it will be for businesses! we all remember michael howard's protestations that the minimum wage would cost a million jobs when it was introduced - funny how he's gone quiet on that one! jobs have continued to increase since this humane legislation was brought in. i think if any job is worth doing then it's worth being paid a fair wage for, and £5.05 is hardly a fortune. if your business cannot pay its workers a decent wage then maybe it's not being run properly and if it folds, a better-run company will take over its duties and employ more people, so everybody wins except incompetent business owners!  great keep at it tony, i remember the despair of the 80s and the low wages employers got away with. at last we can make a difference to people and reward them for working. we can't afford not to pay a decent wage. it's not a jobs at any price economy, goodbye sweatshops hello decency.  the increase in minimum wage is a good thing. living in the southwest where house prices and rent have increased hugely (like the rest of the country) over the past 5 years has made living for you average 18-21 years old very difficult. in the south west the increase in living costs have not been matched by an increase in pay, for example a job i did in plymouth was underpaid to an equivalent worker in exeter by 75p an hour. hopefully the increase in the minimum wage will bring in to balance pay on a regional and national level, and in turn allow people like myself who do work hard, but might never earn a 6 figure salary the chance to branch out on our own.  i work at a large hospital where the contractors providing all ancillary services - domestic, catering & portering etc - pay the minimum wage of £4.85 as the basic rate. someone has to do these unglamorous jobs and earn enough to live decently. how dare people suggest we are lazy or complacent for accepting these jobs and these wages? who do they think will be carrying out these public service jobs if contractors are allowed to pay as little as their consciences allow?  this is definitely the right step in the right direction. it shows that this government cares for the low income earners as well. this is a million votes more. good strategy isn't it?  although i would not deny people the minimum wage increase, its timing stinks. i am quite prepared for a raft of 'bribes' to come from the government before the election and a raft of taxes afterwards, they are playing us for the fools they think we are.  this is extremely bad news for any business - whether they are small and medium enterprises or even large companies. by increasing overheads, for business, there will be an almost certain rise in costs to the consumer who while they openly welcome the idea of an increase in the minimum wage are the same people who still want to buy that shirt, or that pair of trainers for next to nothing. the extra cost this increase will bring, will only be reflected in the price of the goods we buy, which, in turn will only serve to discourage companies from setting-up business in the uk, or encourage those companies already based here to look elsewhere. the jubilation felt by ""low-paid"" workers here will soon give way to misery as they lose their jobs.  this will only lead to a reduction in jobs. why have many of the call centre jobs gone to india. blair say's the economy is ""strong and stable economy"" however consumer debt and the country's debt is at its highest and now they heap this onto businesses, that will have no choice but to cut the workforce.  the timing cannot be coincidental. this is blatant electioneering and should be exposed as such.  andrew in derby complains that raising the minimum wage is 'blatant electioneering'. i don't mind if it is. in our degraded democracy, elections are the one time when elites really have to worry about doing something concrete for the majority. my only complaint is the paltry figures being discussed. if my maths is right, a 35 hour week at £5.05 gives you an annual income just over £9,000 and raising it to £6 leaves it under £11,000. the unions should be putting the government under pressure for much more. businesses complaining might like to take a look at corporate pay, shareholder payouts and profits before wondering if paying a living wage is really a controlling factor in the viability of their firm.  i am all for lifting the minimum wage of workers to a reasonable level, but we have to accept that with this will come competition from overseas workers. also small businesses will have to be able to afford this manpower cost. we are already seeing a sweeping change in it work being lost to india where people are paid much less. it is difficult for me to understand that only five years ago cheap labour abroad was classified as 'sweat shop', but now we are told it is global competition. with our manufacturing industry in serious decline the country cannot be entirely service industries without something tangible to serve. there has to be something at the top of the food chain and that is manufacturing. the whole picture needs to be looked at.  this is great news, but that might be because i work for minimum wage. seems a good idea and will hopefully be an incentive to those who live to claim to actually get a job. when you can ""earn"" more from claiming than you can from work, there is no incentive. perhaps a step in the right direction.  if the tuc get their way a very large number of smes will have to close - this will put more people out of work. how then will the government fudge the unemployment figures! the government know it is not big business that keeps the economy going but the smes but we always get overlooked, they will only take notice if these large corporations close and move to other countries, after all they are predominantly owned by foreign companies. we are a specialist company but with these increases have already had an effect on us and we have lost work another one will close us.  while i'm delighted for those on low pay that this increase is being put forward, i am extremely concerned at the implications for small businesses. as an employee for a small nursery, i know this increase will cause great hardship for my employer, who has been unable to increase salaries for higher paid employees because of last october's increase for the lower paid employees - who were originally being paid slightly above the minimum but are now on the minimum. this latest increase of 20p an hour will cause even more financial hardship. if the rate rises to £6 then i can foresee many small businesses having to pay off employees.  the increase in minimum wage will have a serious effect on my business. although we pay above the minimum level we will have to increase our pay rates to maintain the differential. the raise is well above inflation and without significant increases in sales, it will mean that i will not be taking on a new member of staff as planned and i will be looking to reduce the total hours worked by the other members of staff, overtime being the first to go.  i currently employ 42 staff whose wages mirror the national minimum wage. increases above inflation are fine but all of my business is conducted with local authorities who will not accept above inflation rises in my service delivery. 80% of my costs are labour. the other aspect that is always hidden is that the thresholds for tax credits do not move in line with these increases so that all that happens is that employees tax credit support is reduced by the amount of the increase, thereby saving the government money but increasing the financial burden on small to medium businesses  it is very good that the government has decided to increase the minimum wage - this should hopefully motivate people to undertake the ""lower status"" jobs.  i know about this great idea - don't bother getting qualifications, laze about at school, no need to do anything other than attend so your parents don't get fined because remember, when you do eventually start working, doesn't matter how lazy you are, you'll be guaranteed a decent wage. the ones who suffer are the employers.  i hope that if industry and business have to pay this new rate that mr blair and mr brown will increase tax allowances and raise national insurance thresholds so that the treasury won't take some of this increase off the people they say they are helping, or is this just another form of stealth tax on business through the back door?  i don't believe in the minimum wage at all! i think jobs should create their own wage value and that if people want higher wages they should earn them. now, before everyone thinks that i am some ""rich-kid"", i can assure you i am not. i came from a very much working class background and started work 20 years ago on a youth opportunity program earning £25 per week. i worked hard, went to college part time, got my a-levels and degree & bettered myself. i now earn a 6 figure salary. i did that through hard work and getting off my backside. a minimum wage just makes people complacent.  to ashley, of swindon: when you earned £25 per week, it was worth something. these days that £25 would need to be near to £60 to have the equivalent buying power. i might add, that thanks to successive governments holding down the tax allowance threshold below inflation, people earning the minimum wage are paying taxes that they never would have done 10 years ago at equivalent wages. ""in my day"" type arguments are a view that belong in the 'your day' - 20 years ago!  as a graduate working for minimum wage, i welcome any increase of pay i can get. i disagree with ashley, swindon saying i have to work harder to get more pay. i have my gcse's a-levels and a degree and have chosen to work for a small business that can't afford the wages i should be getting, i should be on at least 3x what i'm getting but they can't afford it. we all work hard but the money is just not there. but on the plus side i love my job and wouldn't change it just to get more pay.  as an employer of staff in several shops the last rise in the minimum wage cost my company an additional £5000 per year. these next rises will cost me more. i have to get the money from somewhere so pass it on to customers. so no one really wins in the end.  in answer to emma from sleaford regarding no one really wins in the end... on the contrary mr blair wins - he wins because he obviously has announced this to be a vote winner and his treasury wins because as an employer you will know that the amount of tax and national insurance that the government will receive from all the minimum wage increases will rise and of course not only will be paying out higher wages but as an employer higher employer ni contributions as well. if the minimum wage increases again and if it hits anywhere near the £6.00 mark there will be 12 more people on the employment line and one more small business going bankrupt - namely mine. think of us employers as well mr blair, we are not all big corporations earning millions.  all workers should be entitled to a fair day's pay for a fair day's work. how many people on the minimum wage have any hope of obtaining a mortgage or saving towards retirement?  it is good news for many asians living in uk. students who do odd jobs can increase their income and can help there family in their home country. i thank mr. blair and his government for increase in the national minimum wage.","the increase in minimum wage is a good thing.as a graduate working for minimum wage, i welcome any increase of pay i can get.the increase in minimum wage will have a serious effect on my business.a minimum wage just makes people complacent.although i would not deny people the minimum wage increase, its timing stinks.i thank mr. blair and his government for increase in the national minimum wage.the minimum wage will rise in october, benefiting more than 1m people, the government has announced.i don't believe in the minimum wage at all!this is great news, but that might be because i work for minimum wage.hopefully the increase in the minimum wage will bring in to balance pay on a regional and national level, and in turn allow people like myself who do work hard, but might never earn a 6 figure salary the chance to branch out on our own.the other aspect that is always hidden is that the thresholds for tax credits do not move in line with these increases so that all that happens is that employees tax credit support is reduced by the amount of the increase, thereby saving the government money but increasing the financial burden on small to medium businesses  it is very good that the government has decided to increase the minimum wage -

"burglar defence guidelines issued  householders who injure or even kill intruders are unlikely to be prosecuted - providing they were acting ""honestly and instinctively"", new guidelines say.  the law also protects those who use ""something to hand"" as a weapon. the leaflet, published by police and prosecutors, aims to combat confusion about current legislation, which lets people use ""reasonable force"". the guidance, relating to england and wales, follows a recent decision by ministers not to change the law. doing what you ""honestly and instinctively"" believed was necessary would be the strongest evidence of acting lawfully, the guidance said.  and the law protects those who use ""something to hand"" as a weapon, said the leaflet published jointly by the crown prosecution service (cps) and association of chief police officers (acpo).  as a general rule, the more extreme the circumstances and fear felt, the more force can be used lawfully in self-defence, it said, adding that householders do not have to wait to be attacked before defending themselves. but knocking someone unconscious then killing them or hurting them further, or setting a trap for an intruder without involving the police were given as examples of ""excessive and gratuitous"" force. the tories have called for a change in the law so householders are only prosecuted if they use ""grossly disproportionate"" force. their demands have been backed by former metropolitan police commissioner sir john stevens. tory frontbencher patrick mercer is now pursuing the proposal through a private member's bill in parliament.  the government instead mounted a publicity campaign to clear up public uncertainty after a review concluded no law change was necessary. home secretary charles clarke said: ""i believe in that old adage 'an englishman's home is his castle'. that's exactly what should be the case and i believe the current law provides that."" an ""informal trawl"" of cps records found 11 people had been prosecuted after attacking intruders in the past 15 years, five of whom were convicted. they included a man who laid in wait for a burglar on commercial premises in cheshire, before beating him up, throwing him into a pit and setting him on fire.  a cps spokesperson said the figures were not definitive because prosecutions are not listed according to whether they were committed by a householder on an intruder. in one of britain's highest profile cases, norfolk farmer tony martin was jailed for life for murdering 16-year-old burglar fred barras, in 1999. the conviction was later reduced to manslaughter on appeal and the sentence cut to five years. mr martin was freed from prison in july 2003. the guidance published on tuesday, said the police had a duty to investigate all incidents involving a death or injury. in cases involving householders attacking intruders prosecutors and police were ""determined"" they would be dealt with ""as swiftly and as sympathetically as possible"", it said.","and the law protects those who use ""something to hand"" as a weapon, said the leaflet published jointly by the crown prosecution service (cps) and association of chief police officers (acpo).in cases involving householders attacking intruders prosecutors and police were ""determined"" they would be dealt with ""as swiftly and as sympathetically as possible"", it said.the tories have called for a change in the law so householders are only prosecuted if they use ""grossly disproportionate"" force.doing what you ""honestly and instinctively"" believed was necessary would be the strongest evidence of acting lawfully, the guidance said.the guidance published on tuesday, said the police had a duty to investigate all incidents involving a death or injury.a cps spokesperson said the figures were not definitive because prosecutions are not listed according to whether they were committed by a householder on an intruder.the leaflet, published by police and prosecutors, aims to combat confusion about current legislation, which lets people use ""reasonable force"".the law also protects those who use ""something to hand"" as a weapon.but knocking someone unconscious then killing them or hurting them further, or setting a trap for an intruder without involving the police were given as examples of ""excessive and gratuitous"" force."
"no half measures with half-life 2  could half-life 2 possibly live up to the hype? after almost two years of tantalising previews and infuriating delays it's safe to say that this is the most highly-anticipated computer game of all time.  fortunately, it doesn't merely live up to its promise, but exceeds it. no-one who plays the finished product will wonder why it took so long. the impression is of a game that has been endlessly refined to get as close to perfection as could realistically be hoped. all the money - or indeed time - is on the screen. the player sees things through the eyes of gordon freeman, the bespectacled scientist who starred in the original 1998 half-life. having survived that skirmish in an desolate monster-infested research facility, he's back in another foreboding troublespot - the enigmatic city 17. it has the look of a beautiful eastern european city, but as soon as your train pulls in to the station, it's clear that all is not well here. sinister police patrol the unkempt streets, and the oppressive atmosphere clobbers you like a sledgehammer. a casual smattering of the nightmarish creatures from the first game makes this an even less pleasant place to be.  you are herded around like a prisoner and have to mingle with a few freedom-fighting civilians to gather information and progress in your task. it is not immediately explained what your objectives are, nor precisely why everything is so ravaged. finding out step-by-step is all part of the experience, although you never fully get to understand what it was all about. that does not really matter. hl2 does not waste energy blinding you with plot. underplaying the narrative in this way is gloriously effective, and immerses the player in the most vivid, convincing and impressive virtual world they are likely to have seen. there are no cut-scenes to interrupt the flow. exposition is accomplished by other characters stopping to talk directly to you.  whereas the highly impressive doom iii felt like a top-notch theme park thrill-ride, wandering through half-life's world truly does feel like being part of a movie.  considering its sophistication, the game runs surprisingly well on computers that only just match the modest minimum specifications. but if ever there was an incentive to upgrade your pc's components, this is it. on our test machine - an alienware system with an athlon 3500+ processor and ati's radeon x800 video card - everything ran at full quality without trouble, and the visual experience was simply jaw-dropping. it is not simply that the surfaces, textures and light effects push the technical envelope without mercy, but that such care and artistic flair has gone into designing them. the haunting, grim landscapes become strangely beautiful. luckily you get time to pause mid-task and marvel at the awesome graphical flourishes of your surroundings. so impressive are the physics that you'll find yourself hurling bits of rubbish around and prodding floating corpses just to marvel at the lifelike way they move. there are puzzles to be solved along the way, pitched at about the right difficulty, but most progress is achieved by force. freeman is quickly reunited with the original game's famous crowbar, and an array of more sophisticated weapons soon follow.  virtually anything not nailed to the floor can be interacted with, and in realistic fashion. you will be wowed by the attention-to-detail as you chip bits of plaster off walls, chase a pigeon out of your way, or dodge exploding barrels as they ping around at deadly speed. at times half-life 2 feels like one of those annoying people who are unfeasibly brilliant at everything they turn their hand to, and in a curious way, its unrelenting goodness actually becomes almost tiresome. running around on foot is great enough, but jumping into vehicles proves even more fun. human foes are rendered just as well as alien ones. the stealth sections are as exhilarating as the open gun battles. in gameplay terms, hl2 somehow gets almost everything perfect. and without resorting to the zombies-leaping-out-of-shadows approach of doom iii, it's all incredibly unsettling. the vacant environment is distinctly eerie, and at one point i even caught myself hesitating to go down a murky tunnel for fear of what might be inside.  the game does have a couple of problems. firstly, the carefully-scripted way that you progress through each level might irk some people.  a lot of things are meticulously choreographed to happen on cue, which makes for exciting moments, but may be an annoyance to some players and limit the appeal of playing again once you've completed it. if you like things open-ended and free-ranging, far cry will be a lot more pleasing. but the real downside is the hassle of getting the game to run. installing it proved a life-draining siege that would test a saint's patience. developer valve has rashly assumed that everyone wanting to play the game will have an internet connection and it forces you to go online to authenticate your copy. the box does warn you of this anti-piracy measure, but does not say just how many components have to be downloaded. the time spent doing this will depend on your connection speed, the temperamental valve servers and the time of day, but it can take hours. it would take a mighty piece of work to feel worthwhile after such annoyances - but luckily, half-life 2 is up to the challenge. it is surely the best thing in its genre, and possibly, many will feel, of any genre. the bar has been raised, and so far out of sight that you have to sympathise with any game that tries to do anything remotely similar in the near future.  half-life 2 is out now for the pc","at times half-life 2 feels like one of those annoying people who are unfeasibly brilliant at everything they turn their hand to, and in a curious way, its unrelenting goodness actually becomes almost tiresome.the game does have a couple of problems.whereas the highly impressive doom iii felt like a top-notch theme park thrill-ride, wandering through half-life's world truly does feel like being part of a movie.the impression is of a game that has been endlessly refined to get as close to perfection as could realistically be hoped.developer valve has rashly assumed that everyone wanting to play the game will have an internet connection and it forces you to go online to authenticate your copy.after almost two years of tantalising previews and infuriating delays it's safe to say that this is the most highly-anticipated computer game of all time.the bar has been raised, and so far out of sight that you have to sympathise with any game that tries to do anything remotely similar in the near future.could half-life 2 possibly live up to the hype?it has the look of a beautiful eastern european city, but as soon as your train pulls in to the station, it's clear that all is not well here.the player sees things through the eyes of gordon freeman, the bespectacled scientist who starred in the original 1998 half-life.considering its sophistication, the game runs surprisingly well on computers that only just match the modest minimum specifications.it would take a mighty piece of work to feel worthwhile after such annoyances -

"china suspends 26 power projects  china has ordered a halt to construction work on 26 big power stations, including two at the three gorges dam, on environmental grounds.  the move is a surprising one because china is struggling to increase energy supplies for its booming economy. last year 24 provinces suffered black outs. the state environmental protection agency said the 26 projects had failed to do proper environmental assessments. topping the list was a controversial dam on the scenic upper yangtze river. ""construction of these projects has started without approval of the assessment of their environmental impact... they are typical illegal projects of construction first, approval next,"" said sepa vice-director pan yue, in a statement on the agency's website.  some of the projects may be allowed to start work again with the proper permits, but others would be cancelled, he said. altogether, the agency ordered 30 projects halted. other projects included a petrochemicals plant and a port in fujian. the bulk of the list was made up of new power plants, with some extensions to existing ones. the stoppages would appear to be another step in the central government's battle to control projects licensed by local officials. however, previous crackdowns have tended to focus on projects for which the government argued there was overcapacity, such as steel and cement. the government has encouraged construction of new electricity generating capacity to solve chronic energy shortages which forced many factories onto part-time working last year. in 2004, china increased its generating capacity by 12.6%, or 440,700 megawatts (mw). the biggest single project to be halted was the xiluodi dam project, designed to produce 12,600 mw of electricity. it is being built on the jinshajiang - or 'river of golden sand' as the upper reaches of the yangtze are known. second and third on the agency's list were two power stations being built at the $22bn three gorges dam project on the central yangtze - an underground 4,200 mw power plant and a 100 mw plant.  the three gorges dam has proved controversial in china - where more than half a million people have been relocated to make way for it - and abroad. it has drawn criticism from environmental groups and overseas human rights activists. the damming of the upper yangtze has also begun to attract criticism from environmentalists in china. in april 2004, central government officials ordered a halt to work on the nearby nu river, which is part of a united nations world heritage site, the three parallel rivers site which covers the yangtze, mekong and nu (also known as the salween), according to the uk-published china review. that move reportedly followed a protest from the thai government about the downstream impact of the dams, and a critical documentary made by chinese journalists. china's energy shortage influenced global prices for oil, coal and shipping last year.","the biggest single project to be halted was the xiluodi dam project, designed to produce 12,600 mw of electricity.china has ordered a halt to construction work on 26 big power stations, including two at the three gorges dam, on environmental grounds.second and third on the agency's list were two power stations being built at the $22bn three gorges dam project on the central yangtze - an underground 4,200 mw power plant and a 100 mw plant.""construction of these projects has started without approval of the assessment of their environmental impact... they are typical illegal projects of construction first, approval next,"" said sepa vice-director pan yue, in a statement on the agency's website.the government has encouraged construction of new electricity generating capacity to solve chronic energy shortages which forced many factories onto part-time working last year.topping the list was a controversial dam on the scenic upper yangtze river.the damming of the upper yangtze has also begun to attract criticism from environmentalists in china.the state environmental protection agency said the 26 projects had failed to do proper environmental assessments.altogether, the agency ordered 30 projects halted.the three gorges dam has proved controversial in china - where more than half a million people have been relocated to make way for it - and abroad."
"iraqis win death test case probe  the family of an iraqi civilian allegedly killed by uk troops have won a challenge against the government's refusal to order a full inquiry.  the high court ruled on tuesday that baha mousa's death in british custody in iraq fell within the european convention on human rights. and the judges paved the way for an independent inquiry by saying previous investigations were inadequate. but judicial reviews into five other deaths in southern iraq were ruled out. their families will be appealing against the judgement.  the families' solicitor phil shiner described it as ""a historic day for human rights and the rule of law in the uk"". father-of-two mr mousa, 28, a hotel receptionist, was arrested with eight men seized at a hotel in basra in september 2003. he was allegedly beaten to death while in the custody of the queen's lancashire regiment. the iraqi families' lawyer argued that failing to adequately investigate the death breached the european convention on human rights.  ministry of defence lawyers argued the uk-controlled area of southern iraq was outside european jurisdiction. but lord justice rix and mr justice forbes ruled that uk jurisdiction could extend to a uk-run prison, but did not apply ""to the total territory of another state"". they said as mr mousa was in custody when he died, his case came within the uk's jurisdiction. the other five iraqis did not die in custody, so their cases had to fail, they said.  and it was difficult to say that the investigation which had already occurred ""has been timely, open or effective"", the judges said. after the ruling carla ferstman, legal director of the human rights organisation redress, said: ""it is not enough for the military to investigate behind closed doors. ""there must be an effective public investigation by an independent official body. only such an investigation could reveal what really happened and who might be responsible."" other allegations involving british soldiers included the shooting of an iraqi police commissioner and the shooting of four iraqi civilians in may 2003. both sides were granted permission to appeal.  prime minister tony blair's official spokesman said: ""obviously we will need to study this detailed judgment. i would point out, however, that a separate criminal case is currently being considered by the army prosecuting authority. ""i can't say anything further for obvious reasons. the mod are considering whether to appeal."" but former british commander colonel bob stewart said : ""anyone at the top [of the military] will be saddened by the verdict that has taken place but will say: 'if there's a case to answer, let's have it out. because we don't want people thinking that british soldiers beat up civilians and get away with it',"" he said.

"italy 8-38 wales  wales secured their first away win in the rbs six nations for nearly four years with a six-try victory in rome.  tries from jonathan thomas, tom shanklin and martyn williams gave the visitors a 19-5 half-time advantage. luciano orquera did reply with one for italy but second-half efforts from brent cockbain, shane williams and robert sidoli sealed victory. fly-half stephen jones added four conversions as wales maintained their superb start to this year's tournament. starting full of confidence after their victory over england, the visitors scored the opening try after just four minutes. diminutive wing shane williams fielded a kick ahead and danced past the onrushing andrea masi and aaron persico into the italian half. his pass to tom shanklin appeared forward but when the centre was held up short, the ball was switched left and michael owen's long cut-out pass gave the lurking thomas an easy run-in.  stephen jones, who retained the kicking duties despite gavin henson's heroics against england, slotted an excellent conversion from wide out. wales twice threatened further scores but failed to find the crucial pass, and italy hit back out of the blue in the 11th minute.  henson, sporting gold boots rather than the silver variety that did for england, beat two players with ease out on the left touchline. but his attempted chip ahead was charged down by orquera, who snaffled the loose ball and hared away from halfway to score in the right corner. with the welsh line-out stuttering and italy twice turning the visitors' scrum, the home side's forward power brought them back into it. but a clever high kick from henson almost brought a try for hal luscombe when roland de marigny and ludovico nitoglia made a hash of claiming it as the ball bounced into touch.  wales regained control with a second try in the 21st minute, henson lobbing up a high kick to the left corner where shanklin jumped higher than nitoglia to dot down his 15th test try. jones was unable to convert and de marigny then hit the upright with a penalty attempt for italy. henson was also narrowly short with a long-range effort at goal, but wales ended the half with a vital third score to give themselves some breathing space.  henson sent luscombe streaking away and when he off-loaded to martyn williams, the flanker showed his nous to ground the ball against the padding of the post, jones adding the conversion. italy, who lost flanker mauro bergamasco with a head knock before half-time, built up a head of steam on the resumption. de marigny landed a penalty to make it 19-8 and a nitoglia break through the middle threatened a try only for the move to break down with a knock-on. but wales put the outcome beyond doubt with two superb tries in four minutes before the hour. their fourth after 53 minutes was sparked by another mazy run from shane williams, who beat several players with ease, and finished with a powerful angled run from lock cockbain. before italy could recover from that blow, a strong surge from gareth thomas and great off-loads from martyn williams and replacement kevin morgan saw shane williams scamper over.  with jones converting both for a 33-8 lead, wales had the luxury of sending on five more replacements for the final quarter. the icing on the cake came with a sixth try after more superb support work, shane williams and ceri sweeney combining to send sidoli over in the left corner. the only downside for wales was a hamstring injury suffered by luscombe. but after back-to-back wins at the start of the tournament for the first time in 11 years, they will travel to paris in a fortnight looking like genuine contenders.  r de marigny;

"parliament's record of scandal  in a locked room at the heart of parliament there is a hive of scandal.  sex, betrayal and custody of children are all there in this affair but this time it has nothing to do with the recent troubles of david blunkett or boris johnson.  few realise that westminster in effect has its own divorce den. for sprinkled among 12 floors of archives are blow-by-blow accounts of marital break-ups - and now you can search what's there online. until 1857, the only way in england to get a full divorce which allowed re-marriage was to obtain an act of parliament by proving adultery or life-threatening cruelty. the legacy is pages of testimonies used in the hearings, dating back to 1670, all recorded among the 325,000 items which fill the 12 floors of the parliamentary archives in parliament's victoria tower. most people researching their family history want to discover some tale of illicit love. this gives them the chance.  divorce by parliament was an expensive process open really only to the rich but the records also include the testimony of maids, butlers and coachmen about their masters and mistresses. among the records is the story of jane campbell, the first woman ever to divorce her husband. that happened in 1801 after she had discovered her husband, edward addison, had committed adultery with her sister jessy.  a transcript of evidence from jessy's maid, amelia laugher, shows her telling how addison frequently passed by her on the way to the room where she had just put her mistress naked to bed. it must have been a killer blow to addison's case - he had already fled abroad rather than pay the £5,000 damages ordered by a civil court. as well as making divorce history, jane campbell won custody of her children - unusual for a woman at the time. but divorces are by no means the only documents in the archives which hold personal details of people often far removed from politics and parliament.  there are the protestation returns from 1642 - lists of the protestants who pledged to ""maintain the true reformed protestant religion"". there are details of foreign nationals made british citizens by act of parliament, including composer george frideric handel in 1727. and the mass of private bills which, for example authorise the building of railways and roads, contain both the names and addresses of those involved and testimonies giving people a unique perspective on how their ancestors opposed them.  tax bills may be an extra source for pedigree hunters - the longest stretches for about 300m and is longer than the palace of westminster itself, listing the names of appointed tax collectors. this wealth of material has long been open to the public at the house of lords record office, with visitors able to phone ahead when they want to view particular items in the search room. but now five years of work has produced an online catalogue. david prior, assistant clerk of the archives, says the catalogue opens up new possibilities for research. ""before, you just could not do it, you faced trawling through pages and pages of printed material,"" he says. mr prior sees the changes as part of a wider revolution in archives generally. ""the archive profession may look fairly staid but is in an enormous period of change, mainly motivated by the potential of it, which is opening up all sorts of vistas for us,"" he says.  the archives do, of course, hold records of high (and low) politics too for both houses of parliament, including copies of all acts passed since 1497 - the oldest dealing with the employment of workers in the woollen industry in norfolk. records for the commons only date back to 1834 - anything earlier was wiped out by the fire which destroyed most of the parliament buildings in 1834.  but that still leaves some of the most important documents of uk political history - parts of the bill of rights from 1689, the death warrant for charles i, the private papers and diaries of major politicians such as david lloyd george and andrew bonar law. there is also the 1606 act establishing 5 november as a thanksgiving day - the year after the gunpowder plot. that document is likely to feature in the exhibition the archives will put on next year as part of a series of events across london to mark the 400th anniversary of guy fawkes' conspiracy. as mr prior remarks as we walk by shelf after shelf of vellum (parchment made from goat's skin): ""all human life is here.""","but divorces are by no means the only documents in the archives which hold personal details of people often far removed from politics and parliament.divorce by parliament was an expensive process open really only to the rich but the records also include the testimony of maids, butlers and coachmen about their masters and mistresses.until 1857, the only way in england to get a full divorce which allowed re-marriage was to obtain an act of parliament by proving adultery or life-threatening cruelty.the archives do, of course, hold records of high (and low) politics too for both houses of parliament, including copies of all acts passed since 1497 - the oldest dealing with the employment of workers in the woollen industry in norfolk.among the records is the story of jane campbell, the first woman ever to divorce her husband.as well as making divorce history, jane campbell won custody of her children - unusual for a woman at the time.mr prior sees the changes as part of a wider revolution in archives generally.the legacy is pages of testimonies used in the hearings, dating back to 1670, all recorded among the 325,000 items which fill the 12 floors of the parliamentary archives in parliament's victoria tower.few realise that westminster in effect has its own divorce den.this wealth of material has long been open to the public at the house of lords record office, with visitors able to phone ahead when they want to view particular items in the search room.there are details of foreign nationals made british citizens by act of parliament, including composer george frideric handel in 1727.for sprinkled among 12 floors of archives are blow-by-blow accounts of marital break-ups - and now you can search what's there online.that document is likely to feature in the exhibition the archives will put on next year as part of a series of events across london to mark the 400th anniversary of guy fawkes' conspiracy."

"'no more concessions' on terror  charles clarke says he has ""no desire"" to offer more concessions on his controversial anti-terror plans to get them on to the statute book.  mps voted in favour of the prevention of terrorism bill after mr clarke agreed to key changes - but labour's majority was reduced to 14. the bill now faces opposition from peers angry at house arrest proposals. lord strathclyde, tory leader in the lords, said ministers should expect it to be ""substantially re-written"".  the bill proposes ""control orders"", which as well as house arrest could impose curfews, tagging or bans on telephone and internet use. they would replace current powers to detain foreign terror suspects without trial, which the law lords have ruled against.  on monday, mps voted 272-219 in favour of the bill after key concessions from mr clarke. the government earlier saw its 161-strong majority cut to just 14 as a cross-party amendment was narrowly rejected by the commons despite the support of 62 labour rebels. mr clarke won over critics by announcing he would introduce an amendment in the lords to ensure the most controversial control order, amounting to house arrest, would be imposed by judges and not politicians. lord strathclyde warned ministers that they should ""prepare themselves for substantial rewriting of various aspects of the bill"".

"hanks greeted at wintry premiere  hollywood star tom hanks was in london's leicester square for the uk premiere of polar express.  the west end landmark was turned into a festive landscape complete with snow and carol singers to celebrate the arrival of the animated film. ""this is leicester square like you've never seen it before,"" said hanks, who plays five roles in the movie. polar express is based on a children's book which tells the story of a young boy's journey to meet santa claus. the 48-year-old actor crossed a three-metre high bridge built in the square, which he said was ""almost impossible to get across"". hundreds of fans greeted the star, all wearing santa hats, and mince pies were on offer. hanks said that the new film has an ""elegant message"". ""christmas is a special time of the year and you get out of it what you put into it,"" added the two-time academy award winner.  ""i believe in the spirit of christmas and i think that's embodied in santa claus,"" he said. polar express uses technology similar to that used in lord of the rings to bring gollum to life. the ""performance capture"" technique enables hanks to play a number of roles, including the eight-year-old boy who is at the centre of the story, and father christmas. it is directed by robert zemeckis, who has previously worked with hanks on forrest gump and castaway.","hollywood star tom hanks was in london's leicester square for the uk premiere of polar express.hanks said that the new film has an ""elegant message"".""this is leicester square like you've never seen it before,"" said hanks, who plays five roles in the movie.""i believe in the spirit of christmas and i think that's embodied in santa claus,"" he said.polar express is based on a children's book which tells the story of a young boy's journey to meet santa claus."
"video phones act as dating tools  technologies, from e-mail, to net chatrooms, instant messaging and mobiles, have proved to be a big pull with those looking for love.  the lure once was that you could hide behind the technology, but now video phones are in on the act to add vision. hundreds have submitted a mobile video profile to win a place at the world's first video mobile dating event. the top 100 meet their match on 30 november at london's institute of contemporary arts (ica). the event, organised by the 3g network, 3, could catch on as the trend for unusual dating events, like speed dating, continues. ""it's the beginning of the end of the blind date as we know it,"" said graeme oxby, 3's marketing director. the response has been so promising that 3 says it is planning to launch a proper commercial dating service soon. hundreds of hopefuls submitted their profiles, and special booths were set up in a major london department store for two weeks where expert tips were given on how to visually improve their chances. the 100 most popular contestants voted by the public will gather at the ica in separate rooms and ""meet"" by phone.  dating services and other more adult match-making services are proving to be a strong stream of revenue worth millions for mobile companies. whether it does actually provide an interesting match for video phone technologies remains to be seen. flic everett, journalist and dating expert for company magazine and the daily express, thinks technology has been liberating for some nervous soul-mate seekers. there are currently about 1.3 million video phones in use in the uk and three times more single people in britain than there were 30 years ago, with more people buying video mobiles, 3g dating could be the basis for a successful and safe way to meet people.  ""one of the problems with video phones is people don't really know what to video. it is a weird technology. we have not quite worked out what it is for. this gives it a focus and a useful one,"" she told bbc news. ""i would never have thought online dating would take off the way it did,"" she said. ""lots of people find it easier to be honest writing e-mail or text than face-to-face. lots people are quite shy and they feel vulnerable."" ""when you are writing, it comes directly onto the page so they tend to be more honest."" but the barrier that comes with sms chat and online match-making is that the person behind the profile may not be who they really are. scare stories have put people off as a result, according to ms everett. many physical clues, body language, odd twitches, are obviously missing with sms and online dating services. still images do not necessarily provide all those necessary cues. ""it could really take off because you do get the whole package. with a static e-mail picture, you don't know who the person is behind it is."" so checking out a potential date by video phone also gives singletons a different kind of barrier, an extra layer of protection; a case of wlts before wltm.

"online games play with politics  after bubbling under for some time, online games broke through onto the political arena in 2004.  the us presidential election provided a showcase for many, aimed at talking directly to a generation that has grown up with joysticks and gamepads. experts say this reflects how video games are becoming a mainstream part of culture and society. the first official political campaign game was technically launched during the last week of 2003: the iowa game, commissioned by the democrat hopeful howard dean. more than 20 followed suit, including frontrunner, elections, president forever and the political machine, which allowed players to run an entire presidential campaign, including having to cope with the media. others helped raise the stakes during the bush/kerry contest by highlighting a candidate's virtues or his vices.  the phenomenon has astonished the forefathers of political games, a handful of multi-discipline games enthusiasts keen to push frontiers.  ""when i started researching political games at the university, about five years ago, i thought it was going to be something that would take decades to happen,"" said gonzalo frasca, computer games specialist at the information technology university of copenhagen. ""i must admit that i was the first person to be surprised at seeing how fast they have evolved,"" added the uruguayan-born researcher, who has so far created games for two political campaigns. many artists and designers are experimenting with this form of gaming with an agenda in projects such as newsgaming.com. the aim is to comment on international news events via games.  the ability of games to simulate reality makes them a powerful modelling tool to interact with actual situations in an original way.  ""video games generate strong reactions mainly because they are new, but also because our culture needs to learn how to deal with simulation,"" mr frasca told the bbc news website. this was the case with the one he created for a political party in uruguay, cambiemos, an online puzzle game that offered a view on how the country's problems could be solved by working together. ""it's up to us to explore what we can learn from ourselves through play and video games."" ultimately, dr frasca sees games as a small laboratory where we can play with our hopes, fears and beliefs. ""children learn a lot about the world through play. there is no reason why we adults should stop doing it as we grow up.""  but experts estimate it will still take at least about a decade until this new breed of video gaming communication become a common tool for political campaigns.  this is hardly surprising, compared to other forms of mass media like the worldwide web. only a few years ago, most politicians did not have a webpage, while now it is almost a must-have. dr frasca said: ""political campaigns will continue to experiment with video games. they represent a new tool of communication that can reach a younger audience in a language that can clearly speak to them."" ""it will not replace other forms of political propaganda, but it will integrate itself on to the media ecology of political campaigns.""","dr frasca said: ""political campaigns will continue to experiment with video games.""when i started researching political games at the university, about five years ago, i thought it was going to be something that would take decades to happen,"" said gonzalo frasca, computer games specialist at the information technology university of copenhagen.the first official political campaign game was technically launched during the last week of 2003: the iowa game, commissioned by the democrat hopeful howard dean.""it will not replace other forms of political propaganda, but it will integrate itself on to the media ecology of political campaigns.""the phenomenon has astonished the forefathers of political games, a handful of multi-discipline games enthusiasts keen to push frontiers.after bubbling under for some time, online games broke through onto the political arena in 2004.but experts estimate it will still take at least about a decade until this new breed of video gaming communication become a common tool for political campaigns.""i must admit that i was the first person to be surprised at seeing how fast they have evolved,"" added the uruguayan-born researcher, who has so far created games for two political campaigns.""video games generate strong reactions mainly because they are new, but also because our culture needs to learn how to deal with simulation,"" mr frasca told the bbc news website.""it's up to us to explore what we can learn from ourselves through play and video games."""
"chinese exports rise 25% in 2004  exports from china leapt during 2004 over the previous year as the country continued to show breakneck growth.  the spurt put china's trade surplus - a sore point with some of its trading partners - at a six-year high. it may also increase pressure on china to relax the peg joining its currency, the yuan, with the weakening dollar. the figures released by the ministry of commerce come as china's tax chief confirmed that growth had topped 9% in 2004 for the second year in a row. state administration of taxation head xie xuren said a tightening of controls on tax evasion had combined with the rapid expansion to produce a 25.7% rise in tax revenues to 2.572 trillion yuan ($311bn; £165bn).  according to the ministry of commerce, china's exports totalled $63.8bn in december, taking the annual total up 35.4% to $593.4bn. with imports rising a similar amount, the deficit rose to $43.4bn. the increased tax take comes despite healthy tax rebates for many exporters totalling 420bn yuan in 2004, according to mr xie. china's exporting success has made the trade deficit of the united states soar even further and made trade with china a sensitive political issue in washington. the peg keeping the yuan around 8.30 to the dollar is often blamed by us lawmakers for job losses at home. a us report issued on tuesday on behalf of a congressionally-mandated panel said almost 1.5 million posts disappeared between 1989 and 2003. the pace accelerated in the final three years of the period, said the report for the us-china economic and security review commission, moving out of labour-intensive industries and into more hi-tech sectors. the us's overall trade deficit with china was $124bn in 2003, and is expected to rise to about $150bn for 2004.","the us's overall trade deficit with china was $124bn in 2003, and is expected to rise to about $150bn for 2004.state administration of taxation head xie xuren said a tightening of controls on tax evasion had combined with the rapid expansion to produce a 25.7% rise in tax revenues to 2.572 trillion yuan ($311bn; £165bn).according to the ministry of commerce, china's exports totalled $63.8bn in december, taking the annual total up 35.4% to $593.4bn.the increased tax take comes despite healthy tax rebates for many exporters totalling 420bn yuan in 2004, according to mr xie.the figures released by the ministry of commerce come as china's tax chief confirmed that growth had topped 9% in 2004 for the second year in a row.with imports rising a similar amount, the deficit rose to $43.4bn."
"giggs handed wales leading role  ryan giggs will captain wales as he wins his 50th cap in wednesday's friendly against hungary in cardiff.  john toshack, in his first game as coach after succeeding mark hughes, admits he is surprised that giggs has only just reached the landmark. ""with the games he's played for united, proportionately it doesn't seem that many for wales,"" toshack said. ""but he's one of the greatest of all welsh internationals and on his 50th cap it's appropriate he's captain."" giggs admits he had briefly considered retirement from the international game, but is now targetting playing for wales in the 2008 european championships. the manchester united wing revealed how club manager sir alex ferguson talked him into extending his wales career.

""he feels, like myself, that i have no weight problems and keep myself fit, so in three or four years' time i will be able to play in the european finals if we get there.

""for this particular game i think it is appropriate that ryan giggs will be captain, it's his 50th cap and he's known for some time about that,"" toshack said. on wednesday night toshack takes charge of his first match since replacing hughes, and giggs said: ""it's my 50th cap and i am looking forward to it, and i hope to play a lot more times from here on in.

"egypt to sell off state-owned bank  the egyptian government is reportedly planning to privatise one of the country's big public banks.  an investment ministry official has told the reuters news agency that the bank of alexandria will be sold sometime in 2005. the move is seen as evidence of a new commitment by the government to reduce the size of public sector. the official said the government has not yet decided whether the sale will take the form of a public flotation. ""the most important thing to decide now is the method - whether by selling shares to the public or to a strategic investor from abroad,"" he said.  analysts say the public-sector banks have suited the government's monetary, credit and exchange policies. nevertheless, the egyptian government has spoken for years about privatising one of the big four state banks - banque misr, national bank of egypt, banque du caire and bank of alexandria. it had been expected one of the smallest of the four big public banks - bank of alexandria or banque du caire - would be sold first. the announcement reinforces the hopes of investors and international financial bodies for a revival of egypt's privatisation programme. about 190 state-run companies and facilities were sold off from the early 1990s to 1997. the appointment of mahmoud mohieldin, a reform-minded technocrat, to the new post of investment minister in july was taken as a sign that more sell-offs were on the way. both the imf and world bank have urged egypt to remove obstacles to the development of the private sector which they say has a vital role to play in reducing poverty by expanding the economy.","it had been expected one of the smallest of the four big public banks - bank of alexandria or banque du caire - would be sold first.nevertheless, the egyptian government has spoken for years about privatising one of the big four state banks - banque misr, national bank of egypt, banque du caire and bank of alexandria.an investment ministry official has told the reuters news agency that the bank of alexandria will be sold sometime in 2005.the official said the government has not yet decided whether the sale will take the form of a public flotation.the egyptian government is reportedly planning to privatise one of the country's big public banks."

"indian oil firm eyes yukos assets  india's biggest oil exploration firm, oil & natural gas corp (ongc), says it is in talks to buy the former assets of troubled russian crude producer yukos.  ""we are in touch with the concerned russian entities about the yukos assets and other opportunities in russia,"" said ongc chairman subir raha. local press had reported that ongc was looking to buy 15% of yukos' former key oil production unit for $2bn (£1bn). yukos is being broken up by russian authorities to pay a massive tax bill.  it was forced to sell its key production unit yuganskneftegas (yugansk) last month after being hit with a bill of $27bn in unpaid taxes and fines.  state-owned rosneft now owns yugansk and russia has said it will turn the oil producer into a stand-alone firm. indian oil minister mani shankar aiyar discussed ongc's plans during a trip to moscow last year, and the topic came up again during russian president vladimir putin's recent visit to new delhi. ""it would make great sense for us to build on that,"" said mr aiyar. india's oil production has stagnated over recent years, and it is having to look abroad to secure future supplies. india imports about 70% of its total oil consumption. at the same time, india's economy is booming and the country's thirst for oil is so strong that it has helped pushed up the price of crude worldwide.  india produces about 793,000 barrels of oil per day (bpd), little changed since the start of the 1990s, according to oil industry analysts douglas-westwood. consumption, meanwhile, has jumped to 2.4 million bpd, compared with 474,000 bpd in 1973.  ""for countries to develop, they have to have access to energy,"" said john westwood, managing director of oil industry analysts douglas-westwood. india is a ""dramatically growing economy that must have access to oil"". by buying into yugansk, ongc would be able to reduce its dependence on gulf states for oil imports, mr westwood explained, especially as the chances of finding and exploiting resources within india are slim. ""we forecast that indian production will go into significant decline,"" mr westwood said. ""by 2020, production may only be at half of today's levels."" ongc, which is majority-owned by the indian state, already has bought petroleum assets in countries including vietnam, sudan and russia. the company is a partner with rosneft in the sakhalin-1 oil field off russia's siberian coast.  ongc is, however, not the only firm interested in yugansk.  chinese crude company china national petroleum has also been mentioned as a possible investor, while on thursday, italy refused to rule out an interest. ongc's interest is the latest twist in a saga that has seen one of the world's biggest oil producers brought to its knees. the dispute is partly driven by president putin's clampdown on the political ambitions of ex-yukos boss mikhail khodorkovsky, who is currently in jail on charges of fraud and tax evasion. yukos has been battling the russian authorities for more than a year and has filed for bankruptcy protection in the us. analysts have questioned how long it can continue to survive without yugansk. on thursday, a us court said it will hear arguments for yukos' bankruptcy claim to be thrown out on 16 february. should that happen, yukos will have little chance of clawing back its assets, analysts said.","state-owned rosneft now owns yugansk and russia has said it will turn the oil producer into a stand-alone firm.india's biggest oil exploration firm, oil & natural gas corp (ongc), says it is in talks to buy the former assets of troubled russian crude producer yukos.local press had reported that ongc was looking to buy 15% of yukos' former key oil production unit for $2bn (£1bn).india produces about 793,000 barrels of oil per day (bpd), little changed since the start of the 1990s, according to oil industry analysts douglas-westwood.india's oil production has stagnated over recent years, and it is having to look abroad to secure future supplies.yukos has been battling the russian authorities for more than a year and has filed for bankruptcy protection in the us.""for countries to develop, they have to have access to energy,"" said john westwood, managing director of oil industry analysts douglas-westwood.by buying into yugansk, ongc would be able to reduce its dependence on gulf states for oil imports, mr westwood explained, especially as the chances of finding and exploiting resources within india are slim.india imports about 70% of its total oil consumption.""we are in touch with the concerned russian entities about the yukos assets and other opportunities in russia,"" said ongc chairman subir raha.at the same time, india's economy is booming and the country's thirst for oil is so strong that it has helped pushed up the price of crude worldwide.ongc's interest is the latest twist in a saga that has seen one of the world's biggest oil producers brought to its knees."
"id theft surge hits us consumers  almost a quarter of a million us consumers complained of being targeted for identity theft in 2004, official figures suggest.  the federal trade commission said two in five of the 635,173 reports it had from consumers concerned id fraud. id theft occurs when criminals use someone else's personal information to steal credit or commit other crimes. internet auctions were the second biggest source of fraud complaints, comprising 16% of the total. the total cost of fraud reported by consumers was $546m (£290m).  the report marks the fifth year in a row in which identity fraud has topped the table. the biggest slice of the 246,570 id fraud cases reported - almost 30% - concerned abuses of people's credit. misusing someone's identity to claim new credit cards or loans comprised 16.5% of the total, with almost 12% coming from false claims on existing credit. another 18% came from attempts to rip off people's bank accounts, while 13% of cases concerned attempts to defraud employers by abusing someone else's identity. outside the field of id theft, 53% of the near-400,000 complaints were internet-related. among the 100,000 internet auction complaints, the failure of sellers to deliver or the supply of sub-standard goods were the most common woes reported. catalogue and home-shopping frauds were next in line, accounting for 8% of total complaints, while concerns about internet services and computers - including spyware found on people's pcs and undisclosed charges for websites - amounted to 6% of complaints.","the biggest slice of the 246,570 id fraud cases reported - almost 30% - concerned abuses of people's credit.the total cost of fraud reported by consumers was $546m (£290m).internet auctions were the second biggest source of fraud complaints, comprising 16% of the total.the federal trade commission said two in five of the 635,173 reports it had from consumers concerned id fraud.catalogue and home-shopping frauds were next in line, accounting for 8% of total complaints, while concerns about internet services and computers - including spyware found on people's pcs and undisclosed charges for websites - amounted to 6% of complaints."
"multi-purpose tv aids india  two-thirds of the world's population, 4 billion people, live on $2,000 a year or less.  you might think that the last thing on their minds would be getting a television set or a computer. but that's not the case. many people in the developing world give up one of their daily meals so they can afford to buy a tv. and now, an indian-born computer engineer thinks he's come up with a way to give them cheap access to the internet. carnegie mellon professor raj reddy has spent the bulk of his professional career trying to find ways to make technology accessible to poor people. the first step is to figure out why poor people would want a personal computer and professor reddy thinks he has a pretty good idea of why they might. ""i come from a village,"" says prof reddy, ""i know what the population is like, many of them are illiterate, and many of them have other concerns."" ""there, nobody will use it for the conventional uses of a pc, word processing and powerpoint,"" he said. ""so it's clear to me that if people wanted to use pcs in a village - it has to usable by illiterate people and it must be primarily for entertainment, education, telemedicine, and access to expert advice.""  prof reddy also thinks that tying it into some kind of aid package was the wrong approach. after all, he asked -- what aid group could possibly give expensive computers to 250 million less fortunate indians, let alone the billions of poor people around the world?  instead, prof reddy decided to think of those 250 million indians as a potential market. the problem then becomes one of making the product compelling enough. ""it must be so compelling that you would give up your third meal in order to have this,"" prof reddy says. ""people do this today with television sets. if you go to india, and many other countries, they will first go get a television set before they worry about one more meal. why? because personalized entertainment has become very important."" this hatched a completely new idea. he calls it a pctvt - a personal computer, television and telephone all in one that runs on a normal desktop machine. literate users can surf through the applications with a keyboard and mouse but illiterate users can use what looks like a television remote control.  on the screen, pictures - not words - designate applications like tv, voice mail, and video e-mail. this dependence on graphics, video and audio means that a computer for an illiterate person needs 100 times more power and more memory than one for a phd. prassana rambathla, one of prof reddy's graduate students, says that ""when you're talking illiterate you're talking audio and video, and that demands exponentially high bandwidth.' ""it can't choke at any point in time, and it has to withstand anything no matter what you're pressing."" ""the major part is making it foolproof, very tough, so that it never breaks,"" he says. the carnegie mellon team says this project is only possible because pcs are now so much cheaper and have built-in audio and video hardware and software. limited trials of the pctvt are due to start this month in the indian state of andhra pradesh.  although andhra pradesh has a fairly good infrastructure but work has to be done to ensure reliable connections to the net. prof reddy has teamed up with eric brewer at the university of california at berkeley. the answer, says prof brewer, is wi-fi.  ""we're looking at the thing you'll see in starbuck's or many other hotspots,"" he says. ""we're doing a lot of work on long-distance wireless and how to make the network work better in the presence of intermittency, when the power goes up and down, and the links go up and down, and the computers you're connected to just get turned off for no reason."" prof reddy says he hopes to lease the pctvts for about $10 a month, and thinks indians will rent the units for the television and dvd capabilities. reddy says he can then introduce the pctvt's other technologies - such as video mail. for example, a farmer could use the pctvt's webcam to send a picture of a harmful insect to a local official who could send back a proposed course of action to the farmer. prof reddy thinks this kind of communication is the real pay-off. ""the underlying problem,"" he says, ""is how you can increase their wealth and reduce their poverty and reduce their illiteracy, and improve their health care.' ""and what i'm postulating is that this is the technology that will enable them. if i didn't have it, it would be an uphill battle. even with the technology it's an uphill battle. but i have a tool. there is hope. i can reach them in ways that have not been possible before.""  clark boyd is technology correspondent for the world, a bbc world service and wgbh-boston co-production","the first step is to figure out why poor people would want a personal computer and professor reddy thinks he has a pretty good idea of why they might.prof reddy says he hopes to lease the pctvts for about $10 a month, and thinks indians will rent the units for the television and dvd capabilities.""it must be so compelling that you would give up your third meal in order to have this,"" prof reddy says.""i come from a village,"" says prof reddy, ""i know what the population is like, many of them are illiterate, and many of them have other concerns.""reddy says he can then introduce the pctvt's other technologies - such as video mail.carnegie mellon professor raj reddy has spent the bulk of his professional career trying to find ways to make technology accessible to poor people.prof reddy thinks this kind of communication is the real pay-off.prof reddy has teamed up with eric brewer at the university of california at berkeley.instead, prof reddy decided to think of those 250 million indians as a potential market.many people in the developing world give up one of their daily meals so they can afford to buy a tv.you might think that the last thing on their minds would be getting a television set or a computer.""so it's clear to me that if people wanted to use pcs in a village - it has to usable by illiterate people and it must be primarily for entertainment, education, telemedicine, and access to expert advice.""prof reddy also thinks that tying it into some kind of aid package was the wrong approach.prassana rambathla, one of prof reddy's graduate students, says that ""when you're talking illiterate you're talking audio and video, and that demands exponentially high bandwidth.'after all, he asked -- what aid group could possibly give expensive computers to 250 million less fortunate indians, let alone the billions of poor people around the world?if you go to india, and many other countries, they will first go get a television set before they worry about one more meal.this dependence on graphics, video and audio means that a computer for an illiterate person needs 100 times more power and more memory than one for a phd.the answer, says prof brewer, is wi-fi.and now, an indian-born computer engineer thinks he's come up with a way to give them cheap access to the internet."

"gamer buys $26,500 virtual land  a 22-year-old gamer has spent $26,500 (£13,700) on an island that exists only in a computer role-playing game (rpg).  the australian gamer, known only by his gaming moniker deathifier, bought the island in an online auction. the land exists within the game project entropia, an rpg which allows thousands of players to interact with each other. entropia allows gamers to buy and sell virtual items using real cash, while fans of other titles often use auction site ebay to sell their virtual wares. earlier this year economists calculated that these massively multi-player online role-playing games (mmorpgs) have a gross economic impact equivalent to the gdp of the african nation of namibia.  ""this is a historic moment in gaming history, and this sale only goes to prove that massive multi-player online gaming has reached a new plateau,"" said marco behrmann, director of community relations at mindark, the game's developer.  the virtual island includes a gigantic abandoned castle and beautiful beaches which are described as ripe for developing beachfront property. deathifier will make money from his investment as he is able to tax other gamers who come to his virtual land to hunt or mine for gold. he has also begun to sell plots to people who wish to build virtual homes. ""this type of investment will definitely become a trend in online gaming,"" said deathifier. the entopia economy lets gamers exchange real currency into ped (project entropia dollars) and back again into real money. ten peds are the equivalent to one us dollar and typical items sold include iron ingots ($5) and shogun armour ($1.70) gamers can theoretically earn money by accumulating peds through the acquisition of goods, buildings, and land in the entropia universe. mmorpgs have become enormously popular in the last 10 years with hundreds of thousands of gamers living out alternate lives in fantasy worlds. almost 200,000 people are registered players on project entropia.","the land exists within the game project entropia, an rpg which allows thousands of players to interact with each other.entropia allows gamers to buy and sell virtual items using real cash, while fans of other titles often use auction site ebay to sell their virtual wares.deathifier will make money from his investment as he is able to tax other gamers who come to his virtual land to hunt or mine for gold.the australian gamer, known only by his gaming moniker deathifier, bought the island in an online auction.""this type of investment will definitely become a trend in online gaming,"" said deathifier.a 22-year-old gamer has spent $26,500 (£13,700) on an island that exists only in a computer role-playing game (rpg)."
"man city 0-2 man utd  manchester united reduced chelsea's premiership lead to nine points after a scrappy victory over manchester city.  wayne rooney met gary neville's cross to the near post with a low shot, which went in via a deflection off richard dunne, to put united ahead. seven minutes later, the unfortunate dunne hooked a volley over david james' head and into his own net. steve mcmanaman wasted city's best chance when he shot wide from three yards in the first half. in the opening 45 minutes united had looked unlikely to earn the win they needed to maintain any chance of catching chelsea in the title race. their approach play was more laboured than patient and they managed to fashion just one chance - a paul scholes header over the bar. and city seemed to be content to sit back and try and hit their rivals on the break as the game settled into a tepid pattern. only shaun wright-phillips appeared capable of interrupting the monotony, looking lively down the right and causing gabriel heinze problems.  wes brown also found wright-phillips to be a difficult opponent when the tricky winger embarrassed him near the touchline. wright-phillips' sublime skill and pace took him past brown and he delivered a pin-point centre to the feet of mcmanaman. but the former liverpool player demonstrated why he has never scored against united by side-footing the easy chance wide. john o'shea was forced off after an earlier clash with sylvain distin and cristiano ronaldo came on to replace him. he immediately caused ben thatcher some discomfort and looked set to inject some much-needed pace into the united attack. rooney was being well marshalled by dunne - but that was all about to change. after the break, united poured forward and there was a renewed urgency about their play. and when neville delivered a cross in a carbon copy of city's best first-half chance, rooney showed mcmanaman how to do it - even if he needed the help of dunne's leg. worse was to come for dunne, who had been having a fine match. on 75 minutes, he scored a horrible own goal when attempting to volley clear rooney's cross and united seemed home and dry. however, city did fight back and fowler missed another great chance from close range. and united keeper roy carroll saved well from kiki musampa. but united could have a had a third late on when substitute ryan giggs hit the post.  - manchester city boss kevin keegan: ""we had a great chance to take the lead and the first goal was always going to be crucial.

"'golden economic period' to end  ten years of ""golden"" economic performance may come to an end in 2005 with growth slowing markedly, city consultancy deloitte has warned.  the uk economy could suffer a backlash from the slowdown in the housing market, triggering a fall in consumer spending and a rise in unemployment. deloitte is forecasting economic growth of 2% this year, below chancellor gordon brown's forecast of 3% to 3.5%. it also believes that interest rates will fall to 4% by the end of the year.  in its quarterly economic review, deloitte said the uk economy had enjoyed a ""golden period"" during the past decade with unemployment falling to a near 30 year low and inflation at its lowest since the 1960s.  but it warned that this growth had been achieved at the expense of creating major ""imbalances"" in the economy. deloitte's chief economic advisor roger bootle said: ""the biggest hit of all is set to come from the housing market which has already embarked on a major slowdown. ""whereas the main driver of the economy in recent years has been robust household spending growth, this is likely to suffer as the housing market slowdown gathers pace.""  economic growth is likely to be constrained during the next few years by increased pressure on household budgets and rising taxes, deloitte believes. gordon brown will need to raise about $10bn a year in order to sustain the public finances in the short term, the firm claims. this will result in a marked slowdown in growth in 2005 and 2006 compared to last year, when the economy expanded by 3.25%. however, deloitte stressed that the slowdown was unlikely to have any major impact on retail prices while it expected the bank of england to respond quickly to signs of the economy faltering. it expects a series of ""aggressive"" interest rate cuts over the next two years, with the cost of borrowing falling from its current 4.75% mark to 3.5% by the end of 2006.

"uk economy ends year with spurt  the uk economy grew by an estimated 3.1% in 2004 after accelerating in the last quarter of the year, says the office for national statistics (ons).  the figure is in line with treasury and bank of england forecasts. the ons says gross domestic product (gdp) rose by a strong 0.7% in the three months to 31 december, compared with 0.5% in the previous quarter. the rise came despite a further decline in production output and the worst christmas for retailers in decades.  the annual figure marked out the best year since 2000, and was also well ahead of the 2.2% recorded in 2003. growth in the final three months of 2004 marked the 50th consecutive quarter of expansion. ""on the basis of the latest information the uk has entered 2005 on course to continue its record period of growth,"" said paul boateng, chief secretary to the treasury in a statement.  the ons said the services sector, which accounts for nearly three-quarters of the uk economy, grew 1.0% in the quarter. the strong services figure was welcomed by analysts, given lacklustre retail sales in december and across the christmas holiday period. ""the fact that other services components are doing so well suggests to me that we are back to trend (growth) and i am not particularly concerned about any further slowdown,"" said ross walker, uk economist at rbs financial markets.  however, output in the production sector contracted 0.5%, the second quarterly fall in row and a state of affairs that some economists classify as a recession. however the ons would not comment on the definition of a recession and whether the manufacturing recovery was over. but steve radley, chief economist at the manufacturers' organisation eef, said: ""these figures remain at odds with what is actually happening on the ground. ""whilst companies may be experiencing tougher conditions this year, 'recession' is not a word that manufacturers would currently recognise."" the ons said a sharp fall in mining and quarrying, which was driven by oil and gas extraction, was primarily responsible for the overall contraction in manufacturing production figures.  simon rubinsohn, chief economist at gerrard, said: ""this outturn (of 0.7%) was well ahead of the market expectations and cast doubt on the scare stories doing the rounds surrounding the current state of the uk economy."" and he said the gdp figures may help to ""push interest rate expectations a little higher along the curve"". ""the suggestion from the money markets is that the next move is now more likely to be in an upward rather than a downward direction. this is consistent with our own thinking,"" said mr rubinsohn. the bank of england's nine-strong rate-setting committee voted unanimously earlier this month to keep interest rates steady at 4.75%, minutes of the meeting showed on wednesday.","simon rubinsohn, chief economist at gerrard, said: ""this outturn (of 0.7%) was well ahead of the market expectations and cast doubt on the scare stories doing the rounds surrounding the current state of the uk economy.""the ons said the services sector, which accounts for nearly three-quarters of the uk economy, grew 1.0% in the quarter.the ons said a sharp fall in mining and quarrying, which was driven by oil and gas extraction, was primarily responsible for the overall contraction in manufacturing production figures.and he said the gdp figures may help to ""push interest rate expectations a little higher along the curve"".the uk economy grew by an estimated 3.1% in 2004 after accelerating in the last quarter of the year, says the office for national statistics (ons).the annual figure marked out the best year since 2000, and was also well ahead of the 2.2% recorded in 2003.""the fact that other services components are doing so well suggests to me that we are back to trend (growth) and i am not particularly concerned about any further slowdown,"" said ross walker, uk economist at rbs financial markets.but steve radley, chief economist at the manufacturers' organisation eef, said: ""these figures remain at odds with what is actually happening on the ground."
"banker loses sexism claim  a former executive at the london offices of merrill lynch has lost her £7.5m ($14.6m) sex discrimination case against the us investment bank.  an employment tribunal dismissed stephanie villalba's allegations of sexual discrimination and unequal pay. but the 42-year-old won her claim of unfair dismissal, resulting from her sacking in august 2003. her partial victory is likely to cap her compensation to about £55,000, a tiny fraction of what she asked for. the extent of damages will be assessed in the new year. the action - the biggest claim heard by an employment tribunal in the uk - had been viewed as something of a test case.  the tribunal decided that ms villalba had been unfairly dismissed because, having been removed from a senior post, she was entitled to wait to see if a suitable alternative position could be found in the organisation. ms villalba, the former head of merrill's private client business in europe, has made no decision on whether to appeal.  a spokesman for her lawyers described the decision as ""very disappointing"", but pointed to some criticism of merrill's procedures within the lengthy judgement. the tribunal upheld ms villalba's claim of victimisation on certain specific issues, including bullying e-mails in connection with a contract, but said it found no evidence of ""laddish culture"" at the bank. ""we said from the start that this case was about performance not gender,"" merrill said in a statement. ""ms villalba was removed by the very same person who had promoted her into the position and who then replaced her with another woman. ""merrill lynch is dedicated to creating a true meritocracy where every employee has the opportunity to advance based on their skills and hard work.""  based in london's financial district, ms villalba worked for merrill's global private client business in europe, investing funds for some of merrill's most important customers. but in 2003 her employers told her she had no future after 17 years with the company, and she was made redundant. merrill lynch denied ms villalba's claims and said she was removed from her post because of the extensive losses the firm was suffering on the continent. the firm had told the tribunal that ms villalba's division had been losing about $1m a week. merrill said ms villalba lacked the leadership skills to turn around the unit.","merrill lynch denied ms villalba's claims and said she was removed from her post because of the extensive losses the firm was suffering on the continent.ms villalba, the former head of merrill's private client business in europe, has made no decision on whether to appeal.the tribunal decided that ms villalba had been unfairly dismissed because, having been removed from a senior post, she was entitled to wait to see if a suitable alternative position could be found in the organisation.merrill said ms villalba lacked the leadership skills to turn around the unit.""ms villalba was removed by the very same person who had promoted her into the position and who then replaced her with another woman.the firm had told the tribunal that ms villalba's division had been losing about $1m a week.the tribunal upheld ms villalba's claim of victimisation on certain specific issues, including bullying e-mails in connection with a contract, but said it found no evidence of ""laddish culture"" at the bank.""we said from the start that this case was about performance not gender,"" merrill said in a statement."
"millions to miss out on the net  by 2025, 40% of the uk's population will still be without internet access at home, says a study.  around 23 million britons will miss out on a wide range of essential services such as education and medical information, predicts the report by telecoms giant bt. it compares to 27 million, or 50%, of the uk, who are not currently online. the idea that the digital divide will evaporate with time is ""wishful thinking"", the report concludes.  the study calls on the government and telecoms industry to come up with new ways to lure those that have been bypassed by the digital revolution. although the percentage of britons without home access will have fallen slightly, those that remain digital refuseniks will miss out on more, the report suggests. as more and more everyday tasks move online and offline services become less comprehensive, the divide will become more obvious and more burdensome for those that have not got net access, it predicts.  the gap between ""have-nets"" and ""have-nots"" has been much talked about, but predictions about how such a divide will affect future generations has been less discussed. bt set out to predict future patterns based on current information and taking account of the way technology is changing. optimists who predict that convergence and the emergence of more user-friendly technology will bridge the digital divide could be way off mark, the report suggests. ""internet access on other devices tends to be something taken up by those who already have it,"" said adrian hosford, director of corporate responsibility at bt. costs of internet access have fallen dramatically and coverage in remote areas have vastly improved over the last year but the real barrier remains psychological. ""there is a hard rump of have-nots who are not engaging with the net. they don't have the motivation or skills or perceive the benefits,"" said mr hosford.  as now, the most disadvantaged groups are likely to remain among low income families, the older generation and the disabled.  those on low incomes will account for a quarter of the digital have-nots, the disabled will make up 16% and the elderly nearly a third by 2025, the report forecasts. organisations such as bt have a responsibility to help tackle the problem, said mr hosford. the telco has seen positive results with its everybody online project which offers internet access to people in eight deprived communities around britain. in one area of cornwall with high levels of unemployment, online training helped people rewrite cvs and learn skills to get new jobs, explained mr hosford. such grassroot activity addressing the specific needs of individual communities is essential is the problem of the digital divide is to be overcome, he said. ""if we don't address this problem now, it will get a lot worse and people will find it more difficult to find jobs, education opportunities will be limited and they'll simply not be able to keep up with society,"" he said. the alliance for digital inclusion, an independent body with members drawn from government, industry and the voluntary sector has recently been set up to tackle some of the issues faced by the digital refuseniks.","although the percentage of britons without home access will have fallen slightly, those that remain digital refuseniks will miss out on more, the report suggests.""internet access on other devices tends to be something taken up by those who already have it,"" said adrian hosford, director of corporate responsibility at bt.optimists who predict that convergence and the emergence of more user-friendly technology will bridge the digital divide could be way off mark, the report suggests.organisations such as bt have a responsibility to help tackle the problem, said mr hosford.such grassroot activity addressing the specific needs of individual communities is essential is the problem of the digital divide is to be overcome, he said.the idea that the digital divide will evaporate with time is ""wishful thinking"", the report concludes.those on low incomes will account for a quarter of the digital have-nots, the disabled will make up 16% and the elderly nearly a third by 2025, the report forecasts.as more and more everyday tasks move online and offline services become less comprehensive, the divide will become more obvious and more burdensome for those that have not got net access, it predicts.the telco has seen positive results with its everybody online project which offers internet access to people in eight deprived communities around britain."
"wenger rules out new keeper  arsenal boss arsene wenger says he has no plans to sign a new goalkeeper during the january transfer window.  wenger has brought in manuel almunia for the last three games for the out-of-form jens lehmann - but the spaniard himself has been prone to mistakes. there have been suggestions that wenger will swoop for a high-quality shot-stopper in the new year. but he told the evening standard: ""i don't feel it will be necessary to bring in a new goalkeeper in january."" the gunners manager refused to comment on the difficult start that 27-year-old almunia has made to his career at highbury. and he would not be drawn on whether lehmann would return for the top-of-the table clash with chelsea on sunday.  almunia was at fault for rosenborg's goal in arsenal's 5-1 champions league win on tuesday and had some hairy moments in last week's win over birmingham. but wenger said earlier this week that his indifferent form was down to pressure caused by being under scrutiny from the media. ""the debate has gone on too long. everyone has an opinion and i do not have to add to it,"" wenger added. arsenal have been linked with middlesbrough keeper mark schwarzer, fulham's edwin van der sar and parma's sebastien frey. and wenger has no immediate plans to recall former england under-21 international stuart taylor from his loan spell at leicester.","arsenal boss arsene wenger says he has no plans to sign a new goalkeeper during the january transfer window.wenger has brought in manuel almunia for the last three games for the out-of-form jens lehmann - but the spaniard himself has been prone to mistakes.everyone has an opinion and i do not have to add to it,"" wenger added.and wenger has no immediate plans to recall former england under-21 international stuart taylor from his loan spell at leicester.""the debate has gone on too long."
